When characters drink alcohol or other intoxicating substances, they may experience a range of effects depending on how much they've consumed. Here are the rules to add a bit of fun to drunken adventures:

## 1. **Drunk Level System**
Each character‚Äôs drunkenness is tracked with a **Drunk Level** (DL). Characters start at DL 0 (sober) and increase with each drink they have.

| **DL** | **Effect**                                   |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| 0      | **Sober**: No effects.                      |
| 1      | **Tipsy**: +1 Charisma, -1 Dexterity.       |
| 2      | **Drunk**: -1 Wisdom, +2 Charisma.          |
| 3      | **Wasted**: -2 Intelligence, -2 Dexterity.  |
| 4      | **Blackout**: Cannot remember what happened after this point, -4 Intelligence, and -4 Dexterity. |
| 5+     | **Passed Out**: Character is incapacitated and cannot perform any actions until they wake up. |

Each drink (beer, wine, liquor, etc.) increases the DL by 1. Stronger drinks (like hard liquor) may increase it by 2.

## 2. **Drunk Roleplaying Effects**
At various DL stages, characters will begin to exhibit different behaviors. GMs should encourage roleplaying based on the following effects:

- **DL 1 (Tipsy)**: Character feels more confident and may act overly friendly or try to flirt with NPCs. They may start telling stories, even if they‚Äôre exaggerated or false.
- **DL 2 (Drunk)**: The character becomes more chatty and uninhibited. They may start to slur their speech or misinterpret social cues. They might be more easily distracted or become over-enthusiastic about things.
- **DL 3 (Wasted)**: The character‚Äôs coordination falters. They may trip, stagger, and have difficulty focusing. Speech is slurred, and they often struggle to remember where they are or what they‚Äôre doing.
- **DL 4 (Blackout)**: At this point, the character‚Äôs sense of reality is significantly distorted. They may believe they are in a completely different place or time. They‚Äôll have trouble understanding anything that‚Äôs happening around them.
- **DL 5+ (Passed Out)**: The character becomes completely unaware of their surroundings, often falling unconscious for hours or until the effects wear off.

## 3. **Drunk Actions**
Characters at higher drunk levels suffer penalties to their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws:

- **DL 1 (Tipsy)**: Disadvantage on Dexterity-based checks and saving throws (e.g., Acrobatics, Stealth).
- **DL 2 (Drunk)**: Disadvantage on Wisdom-based checks (e.g., Insight, Perception) and saving throws.
- **DL 3 (Wasted)**: Disadvantage on Intelligence-based checks (e.g., Arcana, Investigation) and attack rolls.
- **DL 4 (Blackout)**: Completely unable to perform complex actions, such as casting spells or focusing on tasks. Must be assisted by others.
- **DL 5+ (Passed Out)**: Incapacitated until they wake up.

## 4. **Drunken Combat**
- **Attacks and Movement**: A drunk character has a hard time hitting their target and may move erratically. They suffer **disadvantage** on attack rolls and **half movement** when trying to navigate the battlefield.
- **Magic Use**: For spellcasters, maintaining focus while drunk becomes difficult. They must make a **Constitution saving throw (DC 12)** to cast spells that require concentration. If they fail, they lose concentration and may unintentionally cast a different spell instead of the intended one.
  
## 5. **Drunk Companions**
If a character is **Drunk** or higher, the DM can introduce NPCs that also join in the revelry and become affected by alcohol:

- **Drunk NPCs**: Some NPCs might engage in drinking games, try to out-drink the players, or even challenge them to physical feats while drunk (e.g., arm wrestling or dancing). These NPCs can give clues or information that might be unreliable or completely false due to their state.
  
## 6. **Hangover**
The next morning, characters who drank heavily must make a **Constitution saving throw** (DC 15). On a failure, they suffer the following effects:

- **Disadvantage on all ability checks** until they take a long rest.
- **Speed is reduced** by 10 feet due to the exhaustion.
- They may experience a **random quirk** (e.g., nausea, headache, dizziness) that the DM can roleplay.

On a success, they suffer no long-term effects but may still feel sluggish and irritable.

## 7. **Drinking Games**
Drinking games can be a fun way to add interaction. Players can challenge each other to games of chance or skill, with consequences tied to their **Drunk Level**.

- **Dice Challenges**: Players roll a contest of dice (e.g., Dexterity checks or Constitution saving throws). If they succeed, they remain sober, but on a fail, they increase their DL.
- **Charisma Challenges**: Players can challenge NPCs to tell the most outrageous stories or flirt with the most NPCs. If they succeed, they earn social rewards; if they fail, their DL increases.

## 8. **‚ÄúOne Too Many‚Äù Rule**
If any character drinks excessively (as determined by the DM) and reaches DL 4 or higher, they may become the target of a special, random event:

- **Famous Last Words**: They might blurt out something inappropriate to an NPC or another player, creating complications or comedic moments.
- **Unexpected Fights**: A drunk character might unintentionally start a fight with an NPC or another player, leading to a skirmish.
- **Revelation**: The character may unintentionally reveal a secret or personal information they would normally keep hidden.

# Drunk Level (DL) System Translated to Shots

Each drink (beer, wine, liquor, etc.) increases a character‚Äôs **Drunk Level (DL)**. To make the system more accessible and fun, each shot can increase the DL by a certain amount, and the effects will follow accordingly. Here‚Äôs how it breaks down:

## Shot-to-Drunk Level Conversion

- **1 Shot of Alcohol (Standard Drink)** = +1 DL
  - This represents a basic shot of liquor or similar alcoholic beverage. Characters will begin to feel the effects after just one shot.

- **2 Shots of Hard Liquor** = +2 DL
  - Stronger drinks, like whiskey, rum, or tequila, increase the DL by 2. Characters will feel more tipsy or drunk quickly.

- **1 Shot of Exotic or Stronger Liquor** = +3 DL
  - Special concoctions like dragon‚Äôs breath whiskey, potent moonshine, or magical liquors increase the DL by 3 and can make characters drunk faster.

## Drunk Level Breakdown by Shots

| **Drunk Level (DL)** | **Shots Consumed**  | **Effect**                                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0                    | 0                   | **Sober**: No effects.                                      |
| 1                    | 1                   | **Tipsy**: +1 Charisma, -1 Dexterity.                       |
| 2                    | 2                   | **Drunk**: -1 Wisdom, +2 Charisma.                          |
| 3                    | 3-4                 | **Wasted**: -2 Intelligence, -2 Dexterity.                  |
| 4                    | 5-6                 | **Blackout**: Cannot remember events after this point. -4 Intelligence, -4 Dexterity. |
| 5+                   | 7+                  | **Passed Out**: Incapacitated and unconscious.              |

## Additional Rules

### Excessive Drinking
- **Drinks in Quick Succession**: If a character consumes more than 2 shots within 5 minutes, they must make a **Constitution saving throw (DC 10)**. On a failed save, increase their DL by 1.
  
### Stronger Liquors
- **Magical or Rare Liquor**: If the character drinks magical or rare liquors (e.g., "Lunar Elixir" or "Moonshadow Gin"), the DL increases by 2 per shot due to their potency.

### Hangovers
If a character exceeds **5 Shots**, they must make a **Constitution saving throw (DC 12)** to avoid a hangover. On failure, they suffer disadvantages the next day (as per Hangover rules above).

**Note**: The intent is to have fun, and if drinking becomes a major aspect of the adventure, be mindful of how it affects the story and player dynamics. The DL system is meant to add chaos and comedy, but it should remain in good fun! üçª
