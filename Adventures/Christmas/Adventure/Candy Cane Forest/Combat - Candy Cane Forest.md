## **Setup: The Ambush of the Peppermint Sprites**

As the party follows a glowing peppermint stream deeper into the forest, they hear the faint chiming laughter of **Sugarplum Pixies** overhead. Suddenly, the ambient jingles shift to a discordant, warning tone. The candy-striped trees around them shimmer, and **Peppermint Sprites**, elemental guardians of the forest, emerge from the bark and snow. Alongside them, the ground rumbles, revealing a larger threat: the **Gingerbread Golem**, a hulking, crumbly behemoth that protects the deeper grove of the forest.

## **Combat Details**

### **Enemies**
#### **Peppermint Sprites**
- **Number:** 6 (1 per party member)  
- **Type:** Tiny Elementals  
- **Tactics:**  
  - Use hit-and-run tactics, darting around the battlefield and pelting the party with **Peppermint Shards** (ranged attack, piercing and cold damage).  
  - Cast minor illusion spells to confuse and misdirect.  
  - Cluster together to create an aura of *Frosty Chill* that slows movement and reduces fire-based damage.  

#### **Gingerbread Golem**
- **Type:** Large Construct  
- **Tactics:**  
  - Focuses on melee attacks with massive, frosting-coated fists.  
  - Can use **Molasses Slam**, a special ability that restrains a target with sticky, sugary goo (Dexterity save to escape).  
  - Emits a **Sugary Aroma** aura that forces creatures within 10 feet to make a Wisdom save or be charmed for one round, as the scent is overwhelmingly pleasant.  
  - Vulnerable to fire damage, which causes chunks of its brittle gingerbread body to crack and fall away.

### **Battlefield Features**
- **Peppermint Stream:**  
  - Creatures in the stream must make a Dexterity save (DC 14) at the start of their turn or slip and fall prone due to the slick surface.  
  - Drinking from the stream as an action restores 5 HP but requires a Constitution save (DC 13) to avoid being *sugar-rushed* (1 level of exhaustion after 1 minute).  

- **Candy Cane Trees:**  
  - Provide partial cover, but sprites can phase through them.  
  - If a tree is struck by a critical hit, shards of peppermint fly in a 10-foot radius, dealing 5 cold damage to creatures in range.  

- **Marshmallow Pits:**  
  - Areas of squishy terrain count as difficult terrain.  
  - If a creature ends its turn here, they must make a Strength save (DC 12) or be restrained as the marshmallow goo sticks to their legs.

### **Complications**
Midway through the fight, a group of **Sugarplum Pixies** appears and begins causing chaos. They are not hostile but will "help" the party by casting random spells, such as *Grease*, *Color Spray*, or *Minor Illusion*. This adds unpredictability to the encounter, creating comedic moments.

## **Resolution**
When the party defeats the Gingerbread Golem, it collapses into a pile of gingerbread and candy debris, leaving behind a magical reward:  

### **Reward: Sack of Candy Canes**  
- **Wondrous Item, Uncommon**  
- Contains 6 candy contains
  - Potions of Greater Healing (4d4 + 4 healing)

The Pixies and remaining sprites scatter, giggling, as the path forward opens into a grove filled with shimmering candy treasures.
