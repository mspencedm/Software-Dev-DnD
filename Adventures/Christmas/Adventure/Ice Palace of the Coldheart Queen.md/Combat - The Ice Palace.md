# **The Ice Palace Encounter: Jack Frostknuckle**

At the heart of the Ice Palace, the adventurers come face to face with the self-proclaimed master of winter himself: **Jack Frostknuckle**, a mischievous and malevolent winter fae. Jack has claimed the Yulebright Star and twisted its magic for his own amusement, plunging Hearthglen into a perpetual winter storm.

## **Jack Frostknuckle Description**

Jack Frostknuckle is a tall, wiry figure with pale, frostbitten skin that seems to shimmer like snow in the moonlight. His hair is an icy cascade of frost-blue spikes, and his piercing, glacier-like eyes seem to radiate cold malice. He wears an elegant coat of deep azure fur lined with frosted white trim, and a staff shaped like a jagged icicle crackles with freezing energy in his hand.

- **Personality:** Jack is theatrical, narcissistic, and utterly delighted by his own cruel jokes. He taunts the adventurers at every turn, using icy puns and mocking their attempts to stop him.
- **Voice:** His voice is high-pitched but carries a sinister undertone, echoing as though spoken from the heart of a glacier.

## **Narration of the Encounter**

"The grand doors of the Ice Palace's throne room swing open with a thunderous crack, and the chill inside bites deeper than any winter wind. Sitting lazily on the great throne of ice is a lithe figure, his legs crossed and an amused smirk playing on his frostbitten lips.  

'Well, well, well! Look what the snowstorm dragged in,' he says, twirling a jagged icicle staff in one hand. 'You must be the brave little heroes who think they can undo my winter wonderland. Adorable, really.'  

With a flick of his staff, frost creeps up the walls, and snow swirls in an ominous gale around the room. 'I hope you’re ready to chill out, because this is where the fun really begins!'"

## **The Battle: Jack Frostknuckle**

### **Battlefield Description**
- **Ice Throne Room:**  
  - The grand hall is an expansive room with a smooth, frosted floor that counts as *difficult terrain* unless the party succeeds on a DC 13 Acrobatics check at the start of their turn.  
  - **Icicle Chandeliers** hang from above. A well-aimed ranged attack (AC 15, 15 HP) can shatter one, causing it to fall and deal 3d10 cold damage in a 10-foot radius.  
  - **Frost Pillars** around the room provide half cover but will shatter after taking 10 damage, creating a blast of icy shards that deals 1d8 cold damage to creatures within 5 feet.

### **Jack Frostknuckle’s Tactics**

#### **Phase 1: Taunting Blizzard**  
Jack begins the fight by summoning a **Blizzard Aura**:  
- Creatures within 20 feet of him must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 cold damage and have their movement speed halved for 1 round.  
- Jack uses **Frostbite Barrage** to target up to three adventurers with icy projectiles (2d6 cold damage each, Dexterity save to halve).  

#### **Phase 2: Shards of Wrath (When Jack Falls Below 75% HP)**  
- Jack summons **Ice Elemental Minions** (2 large ice elementals or 4 small ones, depending on party composition).  
- He leaps onto the throne and activates **Frozen Dome**, gaining temporary hit points and creating a barrier around himself that absorbs up to 30 damage. The dome cracks if the party deals fire damage.  

#### **Phase 3: The Storm’s Wrath (When Jack Falls Below 25% HP)**  
- Jack channels his rage into a **Glacial Cataclysm**, creating icy spikes erupting from the floor.  
  - Each adventurer must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d10 cold damage and be restrained by icy shards (DC 14 Strength save to escape).  
- He uses **Snowstep Dash**, teleporting to different points in the room, leaving behind trails of ice that last until the end of his next turn (difficult terrain, DC 14 Acrobatics to cross safely).  

---

### **Jack Frostknuckle’s Key Abilities**
- **Blizzard Staff (Recharge 5-6):** Jack creates a cone of freezing wind in a 30-foot cone, dealing 5d8 cold damage (Constitution save DC 15 for half).

### **Narration of Jack Attacking**
*"Jack raises his jagged staff, and a wave of frost ripples through the air. 'You’ll be ice sculptures by the time I’m done with you!' he cackles, unleashing a flurry of sharp, frozen shards. As the room grows colder, the very ground beneath your feet begins to crackle and freeze, trapping you in his wintery trap."*

## **Resolution**
When Jack is defeated, he lets out a dramatic wail, his icy form cracking apart. As he dissipates, the **Yulebright Star** floats gently from above the throne into the adventurers' hands, glowing with warmth and light. The perpetual storm outside ceases, and a warm breeze sweeps through the Ice Palace, melting away Jack’s frosty magic.
