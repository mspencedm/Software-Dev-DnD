# **The Ice Palace**

The **Ice Palace** stands at the heart of a frozen tundra, its gleaming spires rising like frozen pillars of glass toward the sky. It's a place of dazzling beauty and ominous mystery, a place where the chill of winter’s magic lingers long after the sun has set. Carved entirely from enchanted ice and snow, the palace shimmers with hues of pale blue, silver, and crystal-white, its exterior reflecting the light in mesmerizing patterns.

## **Narration of the Outside**

*"As you approach the Ice Palace, you are struck by its sheer scale—an imposing fortress of frosted grandeur, its towers reaching high into the cloudless sky. The very air seems to hum with an ancient magic, cold and unyielding. Frosty winds swirl around the structure, carrying with them the soft echoes of a distant, haunting melody. The palace's walls gleam like glass, catching the light of the sun in brilliant shards, casting intricate patterns of shadow on the snow. It's as if the very essence of winter has taken form in this majestic and foreboding structure."*

## **Puzzle: The Sealed Gates of Winter**

The massive doors to the main hall are sealed by an ancient lock, made up of glowing runes embedded in the ice. These runes flicker in and out of visibility, seeming to change position when you aren’t looking directly at them.

### **The Puzzle: The Three Fates of Winter**
To open the doors, the adventurers must decipher the puzzle of the **Three Fates of Winter**, which is inscribed in the runes:

**Instructions:**: Lay a hand on my icy door and speak in order the answer to these runs and fate will see what is next in store.

- **Fate of Frost:** “I hold the power to freeze the heart of the earth, but I am as cold as death itself. Without me, the land would never sleep. What am I?”
- **Fate of the Storm:** “I blow with fury across the lands, and yet my power is fleeting. What am I?”
- **Fate of the Flame:** “I burn hot, even in the coldest of winters, giving warmth and light to those who seek me. What am I?”

The runes glow in sequence as the adventurers ponder each riddle. The correct answers must be spoken aloud in order to activate the lock. The answers are:

- **Fate of Frost:** *Moon*  
- **Fate of the Storm:** *Wind*  
- **Fate of the Flame:** *Sun*

Once all three answers are spoken aloud in the correct order, the runes flash brightly and the massive ice doors groan as they slowly begin to open, revealing the heart of the Ice Palace. However, should the adventurers speak the wrong answer or fail to align the runes in the correct sequence, a burst of icy magic will blast them backward, dealing 3d6 cold damage and resetting the puzzle.

## **Narration of the Puzzle’s Solution**
*"The moment the correct answers are spoken, the runes flare with a brilliant light. A deep rumble shakes the ground beneath you, and the doors begin to creak open slowly, revealing the inner sanctum of the palace. A soft, chilling wind sweeps out, carrying with it the scent of ice and old magic. The palace, it seems, recognizes your worth—and welcomes you inside."*

If the adventurers fail the puzzle, they will have to try again, but the cold is not merciful, and each failure wears on their stamina.

## **Narration of the Inside**

*"You step through the doors and enter the palace, the temperature dropping further as you leave the warmth of the outside world behind. The air here is crisp, cold, and filled with the scent of ancient ice. The palace's interior is both magnificent and eerie, the walls lined with shimmering ice sculptures that seem to shift and change as you move past them. Long, gleaming corridors wind through the palace, with grand chambers that contain fountains of frozen water and statues of long-forgotten figures. The floors are smooth and slick with frost, and the faint sound of water dripping from stalactites echoes through the palace’s halls."*

The grand hall at the heart of the palace is a cavernous space, its ceiling stretching far above, adorned with hanging chandeliers of icicles. At the far end, a large throne sits atop a dais of polished ice, where an ancient ruler of winter is said to have once sat—though the throne is now empty. The **Yulebright Star** hovers above the dais, glowing with a quiet intensity, its presence both comforting and unsettling.
