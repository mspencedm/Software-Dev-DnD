## **More About Yulebright**

**Yulebright** is a multi-day festival featuring feasts, games, and magical performances. It embodies the values of togetherness, generosity, and warmth in the face of winter’s cold. Key traditions include:  

- **Wish Night:** The night when the Yulebright Star is lit, and townsfolk gather to sing and exchange small gifts.  
- **Snowball Derby:** A competitive snowball-throwing contest.  
- **The Hearthglow Feast:** A communal meal where everyone shares their best dishes, held in the plaza under the glowing tree.  

The loss of the **Yulebright Star** would mean more than the end of the celebration. It would strip the town of its magical shield, leaving Hearthglen vulnerable to the harsh environment and the Coldheart Queen’s forces.
