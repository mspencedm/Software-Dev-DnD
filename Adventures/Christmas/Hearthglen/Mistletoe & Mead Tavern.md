## **Bartender: Bertie Pinefell**

- **Personality:** Friendly, gregarious, and a bit of a showman. Bertie loves sharing tales with his patrons, though he’s quick to lend a sympathetic ear to anyone in need. He has a knack for guessing exactly what someone needs to drink.

  - Refers to everyone as “kid” regardless of their age.  

**Notable Quote:**  
*"Ah, sit down, kid! You’ve got the look of someone who could use a stiff drink and a good yarn. Lucky for you, I’ve got both!"*
