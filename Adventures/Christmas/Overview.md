# **D&D Adventure: "The Frostfell Special: A CloudCutter Christmas"**

---

### **Narrator Introduction**  
*"Ah, greetings, my festive friends! It is I, CloudCutter, spinner of tales and hoarder of… holiday cheer! Gather 'round as I recount a wintry tale of heroism, humor, and, yes, presents! Prepare yourselves for... **The Frostfell Special!**"*

---

## **Adventure Overview**  
The party finds themselves in the charming town of *Hearthglen*, nestled in the snowy peaks of the Frostfell Mountains. The town is preparing for *Yulebright*, a festive celebration filled with decorations, music, and the legendary gift-giving of the mysterious *Father Mithral*. However, calamity strikes when the **Yulebright Star**—an enchanted ornament that powers the town’s defenses and brings joy to the holiday—is stolen by minions of the *Coldheart Queen*.  

The players must brave a magical winter wonderland to recover the star before Yulebright is ruined!

---

## **Adventure Hook**  

The party arrives in Hearthglen to partake in the Yulebright festivities but is soon approached by the town's *Head Tinkerer, Holly Tinseltool*. She begs for their help when the Yulebright Star is stolen. (have this happen with her sneaking into the tavern and getting them - don't want to cause too much alarm) The culprit? A fearsome frost giant named *Jack Frostknuckle*, who serves the malevolent *Coldheart Queen*.  

**Narrator Cue:**  
*"And so, our intrepid heroes—probably lured by the promise of mulled cider—set off to save Yulebright. Typical adventurers, always saying ‘yes’ to everything."*

---

# **Scene 1: The Candy Cane Forest**  

The party follows tracks leading to the *Candy Cane Forest*, a sparkling grove where the very trees are made of striped candy. However, the forest is guarded by *Pepperminions*—tiny, mischievous fey creatures wielding peppermint spears.  

### **Combat 1: Peppermint Ambush**  
- **Enemies:**  
  - 6 *Peppermint Sprites* 
  - A *Geingerbread Golem* 
- **Features:**  
  - Peppermint Stream
  - Candy Cane Trees
  - Marshmallow Pits  

**Narrator Cue:**  
*"Ah, a clash of sugar and steel! Watch out for the sticky sap attack, adventurers. It's the bane of any beard—no matter how finely combed."*  

**Victory Bonus:** A sack of enchanted candy canes that act as **Potions of Greater Healing**.  

---

# **Journey from the Candy Cane Forest to the Ice Palace**

The path out of the Candy Cane Forest winds through a dazzling expanse of snowy hills and frozen streams. As the party treks onward, the air grows colder, and shimmering icicles hang like glass daggers from frosted trees. In the distance, the gleaming spires of the **Ice Palace** rise, reflecting the soft colors of the aurora dancing above. However, the journey is not without its challenges, as the trail becomes a slippery labyrinth of frozen bridges and precarious ledges.

---

## **Narration of the Journey**

*"And so, our brave adventurers press on, their breath misting in the crisp air as the whimsical charm of the Candy Cane Forest fades behind them. Before them lies a winter wonderland of glittering ice and snow, with trails so slick they’d make even a frost dragon think twice about flying too low. But fear not! If these heroes can outmaneuver a Gingerbread Golem, surely they can handle a bit of slippage… or can they?"*  

---

## **Skill Challenge: Slippery Terrain**

As the party traverses a particularly icy ridge overlooking a frozen stream, they must maintain their footing on the treacherous surface.  

- **Acrobatics Check (DC 15):**  
  - **Success:** The character nimbly navigates the icy path without issue.  
  - **Failure:** The character slips and slides 10 feet down the ridge, landing prone in the snow below. Climbing back up requires an additional 10 feet of movement and costs 1d4 cold damage from the icy landing.  

For extra flair, describe the slips humorously:  
*"Your feet shoot out from under you like a reindeer on a banana peel, and you slide down the ridge, landing in a puff of snow. Dignified? Not quite. Memorable? Absolutely."*  

---

#a **Scene 2: The Ice Palace of the Coldheart Queen**  

After navigating the forest, the party reaches the shimmering, icy lair of the *Coldheart Queen*. Inside, Jack Frostknuckle is preparing to destroy the Yulebright Star in a frozen ritual that will plunge Hearthglen into eternal winter.  

### **Combat 2: Frostknuckle Showdown**  
- **Enemies:**  
  - **Jack Frostknuckle** (Frost Giant with legendary actions).  
  - 4 *Snowglobin Warriors* (goblins with cold-themed abilities).  
- **Environment:**  
  - **Icy Floors:** Players must succeed on DC 12 Dexterity checks or fall prone when dashing.  
  - **Collapsing Icicles:** At initiative 20, a 10-foot radius area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 cold damage.  

**Narrator Cue:**  
*"Ah, the final act! Will they emerge victorious, or will they spend eternity as lawn ornaments in the Coldheart Queen's garden? Place your bets now!"*

---

## **Climactic Moment**  

After defeating Frostknuckle, the party finds the Yulebright Star. But there's a twist—it’s cracked from the battle and needs a special spell to repair. Luckily, *Father Mithral* himself appears—a kindly dwarf with a snowy beard and a twinkle in his eye. He uses his magical **Tinker's Touch** to restore the star.  

---

## **Ending Scene: Hearthglen's Celebration**  

The party returns to Hearthglen just in time for the Yulebright ceremony. The star is placed atop the town’s great tree, and joy spreads across the Frostfell.  

**Narrator Cue:**  
*"And with that, Yulebright is saved! The adventurers are heroes, the cider is mulled, and the dragon gets a good laugh. A perfect ending, wouldn’t you say?"*

---

## **The Gift**  
At the celebration, Father Mithral gives each character a **Gift of the Frostfell**, custom-tailored to their abilities. Examples include:  

- **Everfrost Blade** (*Weapon, Rare*): Adds +1 to attack rolls and deals an extra 1d6 cold damage. Once per day, can freeze a 10-foot radius area for 1 minute.  
- **Mirthful Mantle** (*Wondrous Item, Rare*): Grants advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and resistance to cold damage.  
- **Ornament of Protection** (*Wondrous Item, Rare*): A bauble that gives +1 AC and allows the wearer to cast *Absorb Elements* once per long rest.  

---

## **Epilogue**  
As the players enjoy their victory, the scene fades out with CloudCutter’s voice.  

**Narrator Cue:**  
*"And so, dear listeners, another tale of holiday heroics comes to an end. Remember, no matter how dark the winter, there’s always light to be found. Now, leave me to my hoard of cookies. Until next time!"*
