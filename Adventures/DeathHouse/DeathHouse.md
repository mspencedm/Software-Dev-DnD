# Death House


This is the renovation of the Death House - I can use basically some stuff from the original adventure and then modify


Probably will do most of the modifications on the fly but will read through now and see what change I want to make - every encounter is going to have to be harder so increase the amount of enemies greatly - the most part will be creating enemies

Anything weird you see will be replaced with animatronics etc. and then update some rooms and you'll probalby be good to go.


Player can kind of go through peacefully exploring - just read things and no enemy encounters - until they get to the final showroom which is the cult room. Floating on the water are seats and in the middle is a stage setup with an animatronic Bronzehammer fighting Strahd. Players will sit in the booth. They are locked in their seats with chains and the door closes. They watch the rest of the animatronic battle as Bronzehammer chops off the head of the Strahd animatronic. Applause. 

But then the animatronic goes rogue and the head comes back on and it kills Ragna Bronzehammer and begins attacking the players. This animatronic Strahd is the Strahd stat block but much easier as it can't shape change or cast spells - it is an animatronic after all.

Once the players slay the animatronic they hear the below.

"You are trapped! You think this is a game! I am Count Strahd von Zarovich and I do not appreciate Castle Ravenloft, and my house, this death house, being made into a park attraction. I deserve respect. You once feared me and lived under my rule. And you should fear me again." 


The doors will slam shut. Your hear a creaking and it seems like gears are turning - something has definitely changed in Death House. And if players look out a window they will see that a black smoke has swirled and enveloped the players.


The water begins to fill and the room begins to flood and the players need to escape before drowning. 

Once they all break their chains (DC strength 10) the water will drain out. Seems like something in death house has changed.

Now players will go through death house in reverse. Everything will be changed as if there is a giant curse. They will have to have fights and encounters etc. Basically just play death house in reverse.



## Modified Rooms

26.

The twins are ghostly apparitions of young girls, appearing around the age of eight or nine. They wear matching, tattered white dresses with black cloaks over them and they have vampire fangs. Their hair is long and disheveled, with strands hanging over their pale faces.

They appear in front of you, holding hands, calling you towards them.

"Come Play with Us." "Daddy Strahd never played with us. He pretended we were invisible." 

If players try to run they will reappear behind them

"We won't be invisible any longer"

Players eventually will need to attack - they will have chainsaws in their hands and attack.


Rose and Thorn Stat Block Encounter



25.

This room will now be a gift shop with the different alcoves selling different items like t-shirts and other memorabilia. 

Once the conversion happens anything purchased will be cursed.



23.

As part of the attraction and fun have all the crypts be filled with candy before the conversion.

After the conversion the crypts are filled with bones.










## Escaping

To open the doors, the players will have to dispel the curse. Put a dispel curse scroll in room 3 underneath a table or something just in case. 


## Ending

Players escape Death House but are unsure who caused this curse. It looks like once they are able to open the doors the black cloud dispels.

If players re-enter death house it is back to the amusement park exactly as normal as if nothing happened - are they going crazy? Did anything happen at all?
