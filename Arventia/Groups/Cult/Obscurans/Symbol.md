# Symbol of the Obscurans

The symbol of the Obscurans is a stark and enigmatic representation of their beliefs and their desire to eradicate the Arventian way of life. It is a dark and intricate emblem that embodies their core principles:

The Broken Chain: At the center of the symbol, there is a broken chain, symbolizing the Obscurans' rejection of what they perceive as the chains of divine influence. The severed link represents their desire to break free from the supposed control of the Arventian pantheon.

Serrated Blades: Surrounding the broken chain are several serrated blades, sharp and menacing in appearance. These blades represent the destructive force that the Obscurans are willing to wield to achieve their goal of annihilating Arventia and its followers.

Tangled Vines: Tangled and thorny vines, intertwined with the blades, represent the Obscurans' belief that nature should be untamed and uncorrupted by technology. These vines symbolize their desire to return to a simpler, pre-Tearfall existence.

Black Sun: Hovering above the emblem is a black sun, shrouded in darkness. This sun signifies the Obscurans' desire to blot out the light of Arventia and replace it with their own vision of a world untainted by technological and magical advancements.

Sinister Shadow: The entire symbol is cast in a sinister and shadowy hue, signifying the secrecy and hidden nature of the Obscurans' activities. It serves as a reminder that their true identities and actions are often concealed from the world.

The symbol of the Obscurans is a somber and foreboding emblem, reflecting their vehement denial of the Arventian beliefs and their unrelenting determination to bring about the destruction of the Arcknights and their followers. It is often found in clandestine places, signifying the presence of the cult and their dangerous goals.
