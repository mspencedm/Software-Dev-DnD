### *Hosted by the Order of Lunar Ascendancy*  

Taking place on the **30th night of Timewatch**, this Full Moon Festival is a time of **reflection, unity, and ancestral reverence**, as Timewatch is dedicated to **Temporalis, the Keeper of Moments**. The night focuses on **honoring the past, embracing the present, and glimpsing the future**, all while celebrating the primal bond between the moon and the lycan soul.

## **Festival Timeline (6 PM - Midnight)**  

### **6:00 PM - Opening Ritual: The Marking of Time**  
- The festival begins as the **Moonwardens**, the spiritual leaders of the Order, **etch sacred runes of time** onto a great stone circle at the festival’s center.  
- These runes are said to **glow faintly** when the moon rises, marking the past, present, and future as one.  

### **7:00 PM - The Telling of Echoes**  
- **Oracles and elder lycans** take center stage to tell **visions of the past and prophecies of the future** through eerie, melodic chants and shadowy illusions cast in the moonlight.  
- Some members wear masks representing figures of history, acting out moments from Timewatch’s past.  

### **8:30 PM - The Moonlit Hunt (Ceremonial Game)**  
- Participants take part in a **ritualized hunt**, running through the forest or festival grounds while tracking enchanted silver flames.  
- This represents **the eternal chase of time**, where past, present, and future are always pursuing one another.  
- Catching a silver flame earns the participant a **"Seer's Blessing,"** a temporary fortune-telling charm for the evening.  

### **10:00 PM - The Grand Howl: Embracing the Moon’s Gift**  
- At the peak of the festival, the **Order’s highest-ranking priests invoke the Moon's Blessing**—a moment where **every lycan present transforms into their wolf form.**  
- It is a **sacred release**, symbolizing the power of transformation and the acceptance of their true nature.  
- The entire festival gathers around the great lunar bonfire and howls in unison, sending their voices to the moon in a display of unity.  

### **11:00 PM - The Hour of Reflection**  
- After returning to their humanoid forms, attendees gather for quiet contemplation, sharing personal stories of **lessons learned in the past month** and writing messages for their future selves to be sealed away until next year’s Timewatch festival.  

### **Midnight - The Closing Rite: The Lunar Hourglass**  
- The festival ends with the pouring of enchanted silver sand through a massive hourglass, **signifying the passage of another cycle and the wisdom gained from it.**  
- The sands are collected at the end and scattered into the wind as a blessing for the coming month.

## **Sacred Artifact: The Moonshadow Hourglass**  
*An ancient relic of the Order of Lunar Ascendancy*  

- This mystical hourglass contains **silver-infused sand** that is said to **flow at different speeds depending on the phases of the moon**.  
- During the Full Moon Festival of Timewatch, the **Moonwardens open the artifact**, allowing the silver sand to trickle freely.  
- **Divination rites** are performed over the hourglass, with some claiming to **see visions in the shifting grains**.  
- The **final grain of sand that falls** is considered a **divine omen** for the Order in the coming month.
