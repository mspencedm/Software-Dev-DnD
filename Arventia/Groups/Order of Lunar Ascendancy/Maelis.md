## Basic Information
- **Name**: Maelis "The Mapmaker" Moonshade
- **Race**: Half-Elf
- **Gender**: Female
- **Age**: 29
- **Occupation**: Cartographer / Explorer
- **Location**: A small, cluttered tent set up in a traveling merchant camp or near an adventuring guild

## Appearance
Maelis is a slender, graceful half-elf with deep green eyes that flicker with curiosity and wonder. Her auburn hair is often tied in a loose, messy braid, and she wears a simple, practical outfit of leather pants and a soft, weathered tunic. Her most prominent feature is her map-strewn cloak, which she wears like a tapestry, with detailed ink drawings of locations she has traveled. A small pair of glasses sits on her nose, constantly adjusted as she pores over her work.

## Personality
Maelis is quiet, observant, and deeply passionate about her craft. She has a knack for making people feel welcome but keeps her personal life guarded. She is also fiercely independent and often turns down offers of help, preferring to rely on her own abilities. However, she has an insatiable desire for adventure and discovery, which sometimes leads her into dangerous situations.

Maelis can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to her maps, often losing track of time while fine-tuning every detail. She’s also prone to occasionally losing herself in thought or becoming so engrossed in her work that she forgets to eat or sleep.

## Background
Maelis hails from a long line of explorers, but she never quite felt at home in her noble family. Growing up in the opulence of a city estate, she found herself yearning for the open road. After a heated argument with her parents, she left home at 16, seeking her own adventures and documenting the world through the art of cartography.

She’s traveled across many lands, from the bustling streets of great cities to the wild, untamed wilderness. The maps she creates are sought after by merchants, adventurers, and scholars alike. Her most recent project has her tracking down lost ruins and forgotten places, but there’s something about the unknown that keeps pulling her further into dangerous lands.

## Tent Details
Inside her tent, Maelis has created a cozy workspace filled with parchment, rolled-up maps, and scrolls. A large wooden desk sits in the center, covered in ink bottles, brushes, and an array of half-finished sketches. Hanging from the walls are maps of distant lands and uncharted territories. The tent is lit by a small lantern, casting soft light over the papers. A pile of journals and empty mugs of tea is scattered around the edges, as if she has been working late into the night.

In one corner of the tent, there is a wooden chest, locked tightly, with an air of secrecy about it. The chest seems to hold something important—perhaps another map or some precious artifact from one of her adventures.

## Quirks & Traits
- Maelis has a habit of humming a tune to herself when she’s working or thinking.
- She often talks about her travels, excitedly detailing every little landmark or strange creature she encountered.
- She has an unspoken fear of deep, dark caverns and is unwilling to map any underground locations, which she refuses to explain to others.
- She’s allergic to certain types of magical herbs, causing her to sneeze uncontrollably around them.

## Hooks

Maelis, "The Mapmaker" Moonshade, experiences vivid dreams sent by the map Gods.

These dreams often reveal crucial details that can guide her or others in quests, and sometimes they hold knowledge of forgotten places, secret routes, or ancient lands. Her ability to interpret these visions has made her a valuable ally and a sought-after figure for those searching for hidden truths.
