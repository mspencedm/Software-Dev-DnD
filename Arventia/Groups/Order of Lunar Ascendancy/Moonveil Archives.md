## **Overview**  
The **Moonveil Archives** serve as the **sacred library and records hall** of the **Order of Lunar Ascendancy**. Located **beneath the Grand Lunar Hall**, this subterranean library is a place of **preserved knowledge, ancient texts, and carefully kept records of lycanthropic history**.  

The Archives are **not open to the public**—only **trusted members of the Order, scholars, and select outsiders with special permission** may enter. Many believe that within these halls lie the **secrets of controlling lycanthropy, forgotten lunar prophecies, and even accounts of past Moonborn champions.**

## **Atmosphere & Design**  
- The entrance to the **Moonveil Archives** is marked by **two massive silver doors** engraved with the phases of the moon.  
- **Dim, enchanted lanterns** cast a **soft bluish glow**, illuminating the **towering stone bookshelves** and long wooden tables.  
- The walls are inscribed with **lunar glyphs**, pulsing faintly under the full moon’s light.  
- At the very center of the library stands the **Moonlit Obelisk**—a smooth, towering **pillar of pale stone** that absorbs and reflects **moonlight, guiding scholars to hidden truths.**
