### Why were they captured?

These 3 were captured as they were caught stealing from the Temple of Amoria - they need the medicinal herbs to continue the experiements and creating serums. Usually they don't go about stealing but their daughter, Nala, was sick (she's going to be about 6) but since last night was the full moon we didn't want to take her to the temple. For the most part werebeasts - we are just like you - but on the full moon it becomes harder for us to control ourselves - she wouldn't do anything maybe lash out but she's not dangeorus - we are not dangerous. 



## Jobs

They will let the players join their group. Their project is hidden in the shadows but werebeasts are a thing - these people are all naturally werebeasts who will sometimes use the serum to become human to blend more naturally in the crowd.


Their goals is to contorl lyncanthropy to showcase the beauty of what it truly is - we have rights just like you. 


Ask to join but have no jobs at the moment
