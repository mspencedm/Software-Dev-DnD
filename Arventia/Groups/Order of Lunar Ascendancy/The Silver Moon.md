The **Silver Moon** is a prestigious tavern located within **the Order of Lunar Ascendancy**. Known for its high-class clientele and refined atmosphere, the tavern offers a sense of both exclusivity and welcoming luxury. It is a favorite among nobles, wealthy merchants, adventurers with means, and anyone seeking a sophisticated escape from the chaos of the city’s lower districts.

## Key Features

### 1. **Atmosphere**
The Silver Moon boasts elegant, soft lighting created by enchanted crystal chandeliers that float above the patrons, casting a silvery glow over the establishment. The space is decorated in rich velvets, polished wood, and gleaming silver accents. The air is filled with the soothing tones of a live string quartet that plays near the corner, creating a refined ambiance that sets it apart from the hustle of other taverns in the city.

### 2. **Exclusive Patrons**
The Silver Moon is a haven for Aurora's Heart's elite. You’ll find influential figures from the city’s political scene, wealthy traders, noble families, and even representatives from other powerful factions who have business to discuss. Membership to the Silver Moon’s more private areas is by invitation only, adding an air of exclusivity to the tavern.

### 3. **Signature Drinks**
The tavern is renowned for its signature drink, the **Lunar Elixir**. A delicate mix of rare, enchanted spirits, finely aged wines, and shimmering silver dust that seems to dance and twirl within the glass. It is said to have the ability to briefly calm the nerves, making it a favorite among those who wish to unwind after a long day or seal a delicate deal.

### 4. **The Back Room**
The Silver Moon has a discreet back room reserved for high-profile meetings, clandestine negotiations, and secretive discussions. This room is heavily guarded and requires a special pass for entry. Some say that members of the city's ruling families have had their most confidential affairs settled within this room.

### 5. **Renowned for its Culinary Offerings**
Though it is best known for its drinks, the Silver Moon also prides itself on its world-class culinary offerings. Fine dining is served in courses, with each dish prepared by the city's top chefs. The menu changes seasonally and is highly exclusive, with some dishes available only to certain patrons.

## Draven "Silverbrew" Kael

**Race**: Half-Elf  
**Werebeast Form**: Werejackal  
**Appearance**: Draven has short, sleek black hair with streaks of silver running through it, a trimmed beard, and amber eyes that seem to pierce through a crowd. He’s tall and lean, often wearing a sleeveless vest and dark trousers, with an apron tied loosely at his waist. A silver necklace with a crescent moon pendant rests around his neck, a subtle symbol of his allegiance to the Order.

---

## Personality

Draven is charming, enigmatic, and quick with a dry wit. He’s a good listener, often giving cryptic but oddly insightful advice to patrons. Despite his relaxed demeanor, there’s a sharpness to him, and those who get on his bad side quickly learn he’s not just a bartender—he’s a formidable werejackal with razor-sharp instincts.

---

## Backstory

Draven was once a wanderer, using his wit and charm to talk his way out of trouble in countless towns. When bitten by a werejackal during a desert expedition, he thought his life was over. Instead, he found purpose when the **Order of Lunar Ascendancy** offered him refuge and taught him to embrace his new nature. Grateful for their acceptance, he now runs the **Silver Moon Tavern**, a hidden watering hole for Order members and allies.

---

## Role in the Order

- **Official**: Bartender and keeper of the **Silver Moon Tavern**.
- **Unofficial**: Draven serves as the Order’s informal intelligence broker. He collects stories, rumors, and secrets from patrons who’ve had a bit too much to drink.
- **Special Skill**: As a werejackal, Draven is a master tracker and infiltrator, occasionally stepping out of the tavern to assist with missions requiring stealth or reconnaissance.

---

## Signature Drink

- **Lunar Elixir**: A shimmering silver cocktail said to soothe the soul and embolden the heart. It’s made with ingredients known only to Draven, and those who drink it swear they feel connected to the moon.

- **Moonshadow Gin**: A silvery-clear gin distilled with rare botanicals that thrive under moonlight, such as lunar thyme, moonflower petals, and nocturnal jasmine. It carries a light floral aroma with a faintly spicy and citrusy finish.

---

## Unique Feature

The gin is infused with powdered moonstone (non-toxic and alchemically treated) during distillation, giving it a subtle shimmer. Some say this ingredient aligns with the lunar cycles, enhancing the drinker’s connection to the moon's phases.


---

## Quirks

- He can often be found flipping coins or spinning a small silver dagger when the tavern is quiet.
- Draven has an uncanny ability to remember everyone’s drink order after meeting them once.
- He occasionally growls under his breath when annoyed but quickly masks it with a disarming grin.
