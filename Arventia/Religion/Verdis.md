# Verdis

## Origin
Verdis, the God of Weather and Nature, emerged from the elemental chaos that once encompassed the world of Arventia. As Akron, the Creator, shaped the land, Verdis was born from the harmony of earth, air, fire, and water, embodying the forces of nature. He was tasked with maintaining the balance of the natural world, ensuring the cycle of seasons, the flow of rivers, and the growth of forests.

## Physical Description
Verdis appears as a majestic figure blending human and elemental features:

Form: Tall and imposing, with a body composed of shifting elements. His skin resembles bark and stone, with veins of green and blue representing the lifeblood of nature.

Hair: A cascade of leaves, vines, and flowing water that changes with the seasons—vibrant and lush in spring and summer, golden and auburn in autumn, and frosted with ice in winter.

Eyes: Deep and green, reflecting the wisdom of centuries and the power of nature's fury.

Attire: Robes made of living plants and woven vines, adorned with flowers, moss, and crystals.


## Personality
