(Verse 1) *Spoken Sung*

[Am7] Raise your glass, friends, [C] let's make a toast,

[F] In Eldertop's tavern, [G] where we love the most.

[Am7] With laughter and mirth, [C] we'll sing our cheer,

[F] As we hoist our drinks high, [G] in this tavern here.

(Verse 2)

[Am7] In the Sylvan Haven, [C] we'll find our delight,

[F] With tankards of mead, [G] and ales that are light.

[Am7] The laughter and stories, [C] the music's sweet sound,

[F] In the heart of Eldertop, [G] our joy knows no bound.

(Chorus)

[Am] So here's to the Arventia, [G7] with tales to be told,

[F] In this City of Celestial Tears, [G] where legends unfold.

[Am] With a song in our hearts, [G7] and a drink in our hand,

[C] In Eldertop's tavern, [E] we'll make our stand.

(Verse 3)

[Am7] So raise your glass high, [C] and let's have a cheer,

[F] In the Sylvan Haven's warmth, [G] there's no need for fear.

[Am7] With friends all around, [C] and a song in the air,

[F] In this tavern in Eldertop, [G] we'll banish all care.

(Verse 4)

[Am7] So here's to the night, [C] and the joys we find,

[F] In the company of friends, [G] with a cheerful mind.

[Am7] In the heart of Arventia, [C] we'll sing and we'll sway,

[F] As we make memories here, [G] come what may.

(Chorus)

[Am] So here's to the Arventia, [G7] with tales to be told,

[F] In this City of Celestial Tears, [G] where legends unfold.

[Am] With a song in our hearts, [G7] and a drink in our hand,

[C] In Eldertop's tavern, [E] we'll make our stand.
