(Verse 1)

[Am7] In a land of magic, [C] where the stars did shine,

[F] Arventia's birth, [G] a tale so divine.

[Am7] From the depths of time, [C] and the heavens above,

[F] Arcknights were born, [G] with hearts full of love.

(Verse 2)

[Am7] With the power of knowledge, [C] and the strength to explore,

[F] They reached for the stars, [G] like never before.

[Am7] Their spaceships soared high, [C] in the endless blue,

[F] Seeking wisdom and truth, [G] their dreams ever true.

(Chorus)

[Am7] So sing of Arventia, [C] and the Arcknights so bold,

[F] In their city of wonder, [G] where stories are told.

[Am7] With hearts full of courage, [C] and dreams that take flight,

[F] Arventia's legacy, [G] shines ever so bright.


(Verse 3)

[Am7] The skies held a secret, [C] a terrible fate,

[F] A shard of destruction, [G] sealed their ultimate state.

[Am7] The golden age crumbled, [C] into ruins it fell,

[F] And swords took the place, [G] where technology once dwelled.

(Verse 4)

[Am7] Now the Arcknights of old, [C] they live on in lore,

[F] In Eldertop's city, [G] they're remembered once more.

[Am7] The past and the present, [C] in a dance so grand,

[F] Arventia's story, [G] forever will stand.

(Chorus)

[Am7] So sing of Arventia, [C] and the Arcknights so bold,

[F] In their city of wonder, [G] where stories are told.

[Am7] With hearts full of courage, [C] and dreams that take flight,

[F] Arventia's legacy, [G] shines ever so bright.
