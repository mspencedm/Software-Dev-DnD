(Verse 1)
In the heart of the ocean's roar,
Where tempests rage and waters pour,
There lies a dungeon dark and deep,
Where secrets dwell, and shadows creep.

(Chorus)
Oh, Tempest's Maw, where legends fear to tread,
Beneath the waves, where the lost are led.
In its depths, mysteries abound,
In Tempest's Maw, where secrets are found.

(Verse 2)
Through twisting tunnels, dark and cold,
Where ancient whispers lie untold,
The brave and bold seek fortune's call,
In the depths where the shadows fall.

(Chorus)
Oh, Tempest's Maw, where legends fear to tread,
Beneath the waves, where the lost are led.
In its depths, mysteries abound,
In Tempest's Maw, where secrets are found.

(Bridge)
Through trials fierce and challenges dire,
In the heart of the storm, where dangers conspire.
Yet those who dare may find their way,
To treasures hidden in the depths they stray.
