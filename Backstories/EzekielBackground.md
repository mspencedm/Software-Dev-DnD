Ezekiel's tale begins in the heart of an Amish community, a world steeped in tradition and simple faith. As a boy, he discovered a hidden attic in the family barn, where he found a mysterious collection of occult texts and artifacts, remnants of an ancestor who had secretly delved into arcane knowledge. This discovery planted the seeds of an obsession that would grow in the shadows of Ezekiel's pious life.

Despite his community's aversion to such forbidden knowledge, Ezekiel studied the texts in secret, drawn by a mix of fear and fascination. He believed that understanding these dark mysteries could empower him to protect his family and community. But deep down, a part of him also yearned for the freedom and power that the occult seemed to offer, far from the stringent confines of his upbringing.

As a young man, Ezekiel married within the community, and soon they were expecting a child. It was during this time that his father fell ill with a minor sickness. The community was not alarmed; such things were common and often passed. But Ezekiel, ever the hidden scholar of the occult, saw an opportunity to use his secret knowledge for good. One night, he performed a healing spell intended to cure his father. His intentions were pure, but his understanding of the dark arts was flawed.

The spell went awry, and rather than curing his father, it hastened his end. In desperation and unable to face the consequences of his actions, Ezekiel tried to resurrect him, inadvertently ripping open a portal to another realm. Caught in the spell's backlash, Ezekiel was pulled through the portal, finding himself in an alien world.

Isolated and scared, Ezekiel's only company was the voice of the Fiend â€” a being that had been lurking in the shadows, biding its time. This creature saw potential in Ezekiel's desperation and offered him a twisted lifeline. It would allow Ezekiel a chance to return to his world, to see his wife and newborn child, but only if he proved himself useful. With no other hope of returning home, Ezekiel agreed, unknowingly binding himself to the Fiend's service.

Haunted by guilt and the weight of his fatal error, Ezekiel now seeks redemption and a way back to his family. He must navigate the Fiend's demands and the strange new world he finds himself in, all the while contending with the internal struggle of his own making. It is a journey fraught with danger, moral uncertainty, and the quest for forgiveness, as Ezekiel's fate hangs in the balance between the dark paths of the occult and the redemptive light of home.
