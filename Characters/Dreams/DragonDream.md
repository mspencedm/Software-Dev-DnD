# Dragon Dream


## Sanid

You wake up in the darkness. Complete pitch black all around you. Then, in front of you, you see a blue dragonborn. You recognize it for some reason. You step closer. It looks like the blue dragonborn that your wife transformed into during your last dream. You see the blue dragonborn bent down, bowing, her back facing you. You look behind and see what she is bowing to. 

Glowing in fire, you see a giant red dragon, smoke coming out of its mouth. The blue dragonborn stands up from the bowed position. The dragon speaks "Look behind you, Aria." Aria turns around and transforms back into the familiar figure you've seen so many times. The dragon blows smoke down at her and she disappears. 


## Icarus

You wake up in darkness. You look over and you see the face a hooded man on an old Wanted sign. You walk closer to it and recognize it as the man you've been chasing to find the story of, Ezekiel. You turn around and you see a face you recognize, your dear friend Aphrodite. "Find out the truth, Icarus, and clear my name." Suddenly, black smoke surrounds the scene and behind her appears a red dragon who says "The truth will set you free. But the truth is not all as it seems." As the smoke clears it reveals Aphrodite wearing a ruby red necklace around her neck. The dragon blows smoke down again adn she disappears.


## Evaluna

You wake up in darkness. You look up and see the figure of a man, his hands chained around his wrist, kneeled down on the ground, bowing. You walk closer and recognize him to be Sven. Suddenly, behind him, a giant red dragon appears. Sven looks at you, "This is the beast that has taken over our homeland". The dragon looks down at Sven and breathes fire at his feet. The scorch marks leave only one word, Betrayer. He blows a burst of smoke and Sven disappears.




## Tarhun

You wake up in darkness. You look over and see lights glowing faintly. You walk closer and, as if you are looking in a birdseye view, you see the village you once called home restored, as if the flames never happened. You look up and see a giant red dragon standing above you, looking down at the village. "Fire can be so damaging when its not under control. I can withstand its heat." He blows a burst of smoke and the village disappears.
