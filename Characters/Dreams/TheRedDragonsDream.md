The Red Dragon's Deal 

You are giving away your freedom, life, and well-being to work for me. You will get to travel across the realms and do some tasks I have outlined for you that will appear as they need to be completed on this same contract. In return, you will receive, the exact thing you wish for most (the desires of your dreams written and outlined by you below in the box - 150 character limit exists). If you fail a task or break your contract in any way before the year ends, you will not get your dream because the contract will be void. However, you will be taken safely back to the realm you originally departed from in whatever bodily state you find yourself in. Additionally, you will not be able to make another deal with me again for another 6 months or unless otherwise an exception is made. Please sign your name below.
