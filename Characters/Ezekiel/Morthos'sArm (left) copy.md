# Morthos's Arm


## Summary

The second time Ezekiel doesn't obey, Morthos will initiate Morthos's Revenge. 

If the shadows ever down Ezekiel during Morthos's Revenge, rather than killing him, they will perform Morthos's Arm on Morthos's behalf.


### Shadow Inflicted

If the shadows down Ezekiel, on their next turn, rather than attacking him and causing him to fail 2 death saves, they will remove his arm and replace it with a shadow one.

### Morthos Inflicted

If the shadows do not down Ezekiel during Morhtos's Revenge, then Morthos will summon Ezekiel to his realm. He will create a portal that sucks Ezekiel inside. There, he will appear, strip Ezekiel of his arm, and replace it with a shadow one.


### Morthos's Arm

This will now be his non-dominant arm - or left arm

Morhtos will say:

"Servant of Shadows,

You still have not learned. I continually show you grace and mercy. Both of your arms will now be mine. You will serve me. I don't want this to be something that happens often between us, unless you will run out of body parts for me to take."

Morthos will depart and you will return right back to where you were.


### Effects

It behaves like a normal arm. Occassionally Morthos will take control of it. People notice it is different, it is completely dark and black made of shadow 

The first time Ezekiel tries to cast Eldritch Blast, the Curse of Morthos is afflicted.


### Curse of Morthos

You will not defy Morthos. Morthos is in control. Everytime Ezekiel casts Eldritch Blast (Somatically - special exception if a sorcerer and uses silent spell on Eldritch Blast), he will do more damage but also take damage.

Eldritch Blast now does an additional d6 per beam. It will no longer hurt the undead and will heal any shadow enemies Morthos sends or players encounter.

Each time it is cast, the player must take an additional d4 of damage.
