# Morthos's Arm


## Summary

The first time Ezekiel doesn't obey, Morthos will initiate Morthos's Revenge. 

If the shadows ever down Ezekiel during Morthos's Revenge, rather than killing him, they will perform Morthos's Arm on Morthos's behalf.


### Shadow Inflicted

If the shadows down Ezekiel, on their next turn, rather than attacking him and causing him to fail 2 death saves, they will remove his arm and replace it with a shadow one.

### Morthos Inflicted

If the shadows do not down Ezekiel during Morhtos's Revenge, then Morthos will summon Ezekiel to his realm. He will create a portal that sucks Ezekiel inside. There, he will appear, strip Ezekiel of his arm, and replace it with a shadow one.


### Morthos's Arm

This will start with his dominant arm - right arm, which will be ripped from him. 

Morhtos will say:

"Servant of Shadows
