# Morthos's Arm


## Summary

The first time Ezekiel doesn't obey, Morthos will initiate Morthos's Revenge. 

If the shadows ever down Ezekiel during Morthos's Revenge, rather than killing him, they will perform Morthos's Arm on Morthos's behalf.


### Shadow Inflicted

If the shadows down Ezekiel, on their next turn, rather than attacking him and causing him to fail 2 death saves, they will remove his arm and replace it with a shadow one.

### Morthos Inflicted

If the shadows do not down Ezekiel during Morhtos's Revenge, then Morthos will summon Ezekiel to his realm. He will create a portal that sucks Ezekiel inside. There, he will appear, strip Ezekiel of his arm, and replace it with a shadow one.


### Morthos's Arm

This will start with his dominant arm - right arm, which will be ripped from him. 

Morhtos will say:

"Servant of Shadows,

Your defiance has not gone unnoticed. In your arrogance, you have dared to challenge the authority of the shadows, my authority, the power of Morthos. Such insolence will not be tolerated. Know this, your disobedience carries consequences. As a reminder of your place within the shadows, I shall claim that which you hold dear, a semblance of control you have. Your mortal limb. Your right arm is mine. Perhaps then you will better do my bidding."

After he says this, he will rip your right arm off and it will be replaced with an arm of shadow, it is quite painful. You have control of your arm and it feels pretty normal. You are able to grab things with this arm made of shadows, which is hard to comprehend, such magic. 

"This arm of shadow is a symbol of your servitude and submission and obedience to me. It will also remind you to keep your place. I am in control. I have the power. Do not defy me."

With that, you notice you lose control of your own arm of shadow. You begin to choke yourself. Before you pass out, as you gasp for breath, the shadow arm around your neck loosens. 

"Let this be a lesson to you and a reminder if you dare challenge my authority again. Obey without question, lest the shadow will claim more and more. Obey, or there will only be shadow left."

Morthos will depart and you will return right back to where you were.


### Effects

It behaves like a normal arm. Occassionally Morthos will take control of it. People notice it is different, it is completely dark and black made of shadow 

The first time Ezekiel casts Eldritch Blast after this, the shadow arm effect will take place. The attack will instead be a shadowy beam of energy. It does an additional d4 of damage per beam. It will no longer hurt the undead and will heal any shadow enemies Morthos sends or players encounter.
