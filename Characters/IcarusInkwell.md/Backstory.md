Rising from the heart of the vast, enigmatic sea, the tower stood as a silent testament to forgotten ages. Its origins shrouded in mystery, whispers of its existence had echoed through countless generations of sailors. One day, a ship crewed by a band of intrepid adventurers dared to approach the tower, drawn by an irresistible curiosity. They lowered rowboats, their hearts pounding with anticipation, and clambered up the weathered stone walls, finding entrance through one of the tower's numerous balconies.

A gasp of horror escaped their lips as they found themselves face-to-face with grotesque, monstrous creatures. A desperate battle ensued, with the adventurers fighting for their very lives, narrowly avoiding being flung from the treacherous heights of the balcony. Reinforcements arrived from the ship, gradually overwhelming the monsters, allowing the adventurers to cautiously penetrate the depths of the tower.

Dimly lit by flickering torches, the vast interior revealed a labyrinthine network of chambers and corridors. Strange, alien roots snaked along the walls, winding their way through openings in the floors, providing an eerie pathway between levels. The adventurers established a makeshift camp on the first floor and began their arduous ascent, meticulously exploring each successive level. Weeks turned into months, their supplies dwindling, and the ship itself was slowly dismantled for fuel and building materials.
The crew divided into four distinct groups: the first, initially tasked with maintaining the ship and fishing, succumbed to the all-consuming obsession with reaching the tower's summit and joined the others in disassembling their vessel. The second group remained on the base floor, collecting rainwater, organizing provisions, and ensuring the vital link to their source of sustenance. The third group, composed of the strongest and most agile sailors, shouldered the burden of transporting supplies to the lead group, who were charged with clearing each floor of its monstrous inhabitants.

Finally, after months of grueling effort, the lead group emerged onto the topmost floor, bathed in the warm glow of daylight beamed through the open ceiling. To their astonishment, the floor was devoid of any threats, occupied only by a solitary, colossal tree that reached towards the open sky. Carvings adorned the base of the tree, hinting at an ancient, indecipherable language. A peculiar detail caught their attention: the floor around the tree was utterly devoid of debris, not a single branch, twig, or leaf to be found.

One of the adventurers, driven by curiosity, scaled the tree, only for the branch he clung to snap unexpectedly. A collective gasp rose from the group below as they witnessed the man falling, yet his descent was unnaturally slow, almost as if he were floating. The group immediately realized the significance of this and burst into cheers. They had stumbled upon a magical tree.

Over time, the sailors transformed into settlers, establishing a thriving community they christened "Tower Town." They honed the skills of crafting large branches of the tree into sticks that, with the correct weight ratio, could float a person indefinitely. Sitting on the carved branch proved difficult due to the branch tending to lean forward or backward. To fix this, normal straw was added to the end of the branch, which acted as a counterweight. This gave the branches a broom-like look, leading to the name magic brooms. The town prospered, fueled by the knowledge gleaned from deciphering the ancient carvings, which revealed the secrets of magic. Warriors evolved into wizards, and the town's reputation grew as a center of magical learning and innovation.

Over the course of many generations, the town slowly flourished. With the tree's carvings slowly being deciphered, the townsfolk learned the ways of magic. Warriors shifted to wizards, and magic was embraced all around. The magic brooms were eventually equipped with enchantments that linked them to particular users to prevent them from falling into the hands of outsiders. While the main source of food continued to come from the sea, fishing took place while balancing on magic brooms. The tower's many large balconies were slowly covered in soil gathered from the mainland and used to grow crops and herbs. Anything the tower couldn't produce could be purchased through trade. Initially, this trade consisted of magic potions and services like enchanting and training, but as magic became more and more common, Tower Town had to evolve. While everyone agreed selling the magic brooms was out of the question, the town figured out a way to leverage the magic brooms to deliver mail and small packages, eventually becoming a world-famous provider of news. The townsfolk composed completely of humans, and while other races were known to them, outsiders were generally looked at with great suspicion and, aside from the occasional doctor, were never invited to the town.

As the town's population continued to grow, the empty tower floors filled out, leaving only the floors beneath the base floor left to move into. These floors were widely neglected due to their lack of sunlight and balconies. Once again, a lead party was formed. The strongest wizards of the time ventured into the lower floors. They were full of confidence, knowing that they had advanced their magic skills over the centuries since the last lead party cleared the upper floors. Everyone expected them to make quick work of the monsters below. As weeks turned to months and after the resupply group never returned, the town realized the two groups who had delved below were likely gone for good. As a result, the town sealed the lower floors and posted a guard force to ensure monsters from below did not leak to the upper floors.

Fast forward to the present day, and a young man named Icarus Inkwell finds himself a resident of Tower Town. Just landing his first promotion at his job, he is now a senior staff member at The Arcane Scandal. This is a fringe news outlet that produces sensationalist and conspiracy-laden stories in their paper. While Icarus had hoped to land a job at a more established news outlet, his poor performance in school and his interviews left The Arcane Scandal as his only option. This left him nonetheless determined to make a name for himself among his journalist peers. Now having the title of senior grants him the privilege to find his own stories, and even more importantly, do his own research out in the field. Longing to write articles that shine a light on injustices and to clear the names of those wrongly accused, this stemmed from his childhood friend being wrongfully blamed for a crime and banished from Tower Town. He hoped to build his influence as a respected reporter and clear his friend's name once and for all. Looking into where to start his legacy, he stumbles across news of a man being killed mere days after assaulting a woman in a marketplace. With a punishment so severe, Icarus looked closer and noticed more and more didn’t add up. While the man who assaulted the woman clearly was deserving of some form of punishment, the party he accompanied were all arrested and sentenced to death as well, only surviving thanks to a jailbreak hours beforehand. With too many questions hanging, Icarus mentions the loose details to his editor, who, smelling a scandal, greenlights the investigation. With that, Icarus grabs his broom, ink, and paper and takes off from one of the tower’s balconies on his way to find and interview the accused party, hoping to uncover the truth and clear their name.
