Tarhun has traversed life with a single question echoing in his mind: “What does it mean to be a family?” Born as a lost egg, he emerged into a world where survival meant relying on the kindness of a few humble peasants. But fate, ever indifferent, engulfed their village in flames, leaving nothing and no one behind. Stripped of everything, Tarhun turned to thievery, scraping together a life on the unforgiving streets. Failed heists and desperate pickpocketing honed his skills, transforming him into a fighter by necessity.

Yet, as the sands of time flowed, Tarhun’s ill-fated larceny led him to the wrong mark—or perhaps the right one. Instead of retribution, the individual he attempted to rob saw potential. Kael, a fellow dragonborn, recognized Tarhun as a fitting candidate for the Coinfire Consortium. Now, Tarhun treads the path of the guild, striving to fulfill whatever tasks are set before him. Perhaps solace awaits within the Consortium, a cure for his lonely existence. Or perhaps, like the flicker of a distant flame, it seeks to fulfill another tragedy in the making.
