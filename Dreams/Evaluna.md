# Dream 1

As you wander the familiar halls of your home, the castle that has been your sanctuary for as long as you can remember, you find yourself drawn to the grandeur of the throne room. But instead of stepping inside, you pause, your curiosity piqued by the faint murmur of voices drifting through the hallway, the wooden doors to the throne room open.

Straining to catch snippets of the conversation beyond, you listen intently as your father's deep voice resonates through the chamber, intermingling with the soft tones of a woman you don't recognize. Their words are muffled, elusive, but you sense the weight of their discussion hanging heavy in the air.

"We rely heavily on trade with the Fey," your father's voice rumbles with concern, the weight of responsibility evident in his tone. "I am not sure what this dependency will mean for the future of Eldertop, of Arventia. We must become more self-sufficient. But how? People will always choose convenience over doing what's right. We will have to force them to become self-sufficient."

The woman's response is measured, her words carrying a hint of skepticism. "You talk of big changes, but they will never occur. Arventia is set in its ways, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. We all benefit from the Fey."

Your father's tone grows somber, his concern palpable. "It's dangerous, the way we are going now. I must make changes to protect us, for the future of Arventia."

Suddenly, you feel a chill run down your spine as your father's gaze falls upon your shadow, lingering just outside the threshold of the throne room. With a sense of foreboding, he calls you into the chamber, disrupting the conversation before you can glean any more insight.

As you step forward to obey his summons, the world around you blurs and fades, and you find yourself jolting awake, the echoes of your father's words still lingering in your mind like a haunting melody.

## Notes
Evaluna is in the castle she calls home, wandering the halls at night. You are approaching the throne room, but instead of going in, you linger as you hear voices. You don't catch most of the conversation, but you know you're dad is talking to someone in there. You hear a woman's voice speak back to your father. This is their conversation. "We rely heavily on trade with the Fey. I am not sure what this dependency will mean for the future of Eldertop, of Arventia. We must become more self sufficeint. But how? People will always choose convenience over doing what's right. We will have to force them to become self sufficeint" The woman responds "You talk of big changes, they will never occur. Arventia is set in its ways, and its not bad. We all benefit from the Fey" He responds "It's dangerous, the way we are going now. I must make changes to protect us, for the future of Arventia." You try to walk closer to hear better but your father catches a glimpse of your shadow and goes quiet. He summons you into the throne room. Before you can step foot inside, you wake up.
