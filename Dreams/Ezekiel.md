# Dream 1

As you sit beside your father's bed, the room bathed in the soft glow of flickering candlelight, you feel the weight of despair pressing down upon you like a suffocating blanket. Your father lies before you, his once-strong frame now frail and weak, his breaths coming in ragged gasps. Each wheeze is a painful reminder of the inevitable – his time is running out, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

With trembling hands, you reach out, grasping for a sliver of hope amidst the darkness. You reach out into the weave and begin to form intricate patterns of magic, whispering incantations in a desperate bid to heal him. But as the arcane energies swirl around you, fueled by your desperation and fear, they take on a dark and twisted form. Terror grips your heart as you watch in horror as the magic you wielded with such hope turns against you, hastening your father's demise instead of easing his suffering.

In a last-ditch effort to defy fate, you reach out with all the power at your command, attempting to wrench your father back from the brink of death. But your efforts only serve to tear a rift in the fabric of reality, plunging you both into a nightmarish realm of shadows and despair.

In this strange and otherworldly place, you find yourself confronted by a figure cloaked in darkness and shadow, his presence oozing malevolence and malice. His voice cuts through the silence like a knife, chilling you to the bone as he speaks.

"You seem lost," he says, his words dripping with contempt. "Away from home? You think yourself powerful enough to control fate? Not even the gods possess such hubris."

You look at the shadowy figure in front of you.

"I am Morthos, ruler of shadows. Let's make a deal"

His offer is clear – to return to your world, but at a price. Bound to him, your fate no longer your own, you must submit to his will.

With a heavy heart and a sense of resignation, you nod in reluctant agreement. And as the world spins and twists around you, casting you into the depths of darkness, you can't help but wonder if you have sealed your own fate or merely awakened to the true nature of the shadows that lurk within.


## Notes
Ezekiel is sitting in a basic house next to a bed. In the bed lay his father, breathing heavily, dying from illness, any second he could go. Ezekiel places a hand on his father, starting to speak words, an incantation, a spell to heal him. The spell goes awry and Ezekiel watches in horror as the blood drains from his father's face and he breathes his last. Ezekiel tries to raise him from the dead, which causes a rift portal to open, sucking his father and him inside, where the yare in a strange world. His father's body lying there. Then, a strange, dark cloaked figure appears. Darkness wraps around him and comes out of him almost like wings. He looks at Ezekiel and says "You seem lost, away from home? You have twisted magic and tried to control fate, something you think you're powerful enough to do? Not even the gods have that power. I can save you. I am Morthos, ruler of shadows. I will bring you back to your World, you can return to your pathetic life, but for a price. You are bound to me, you will obey me. Your life is mine. Are we agreed?" When you nod your head, the world spins and you are cast into darkness, where you wake up.
