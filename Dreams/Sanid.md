# Dream 1

As you labor tirelessly over the forge, the rhythmic clang of hammer meeting metal echoing through the air, you lose yourself in the art of crafting a sword. Hours slip away unnoticed, consumed by the passion and dedication you pour into your work.

Finally, as twilight descends and darkness creeps over the horizon, you realize with a start that the day has long since passed. With a sense of excitement and anticipation, you bid farewell to your father, who like you, toils away into the late hours of the night.

As you make the familiar journey back home, the world around you bathed in the soft hues of dusk, you can't shake the feeling of unease gnawing at the edges of your consciousness. The air feels charged, heavy with a palpable sense of disquiet.

With each step, the feeling of apprehension grows, until it becomes a pounding drumbeat in your chest. Without fully understanding why, you break into a run, your feet carrying you swiftly through the dimly lit streets.

And then, in the dim glow of the street lamps, you see it â€“ a burnt figure lying motionless in a pool of crimson, the metallic tang of blood thick in the air. You needn't draw closer to recognize the lifeless form, for you know in your heart who it is.

Tears blur your vision as grief washes over you like a tidal wave, shaking you to your core. Your world, once so steady and sure, is now shattered into a million fragmented pieces. Anguish and rage intertwine within you, fueling a burning resolve to seek justice for the one you have lost.

With a steely determination, you vow to find the person responsible, to bring them to account for their heinous deed. Revenge becomes your singular purpose, driving you forward through the darkness that now envelops your once serene existence.

## Notes

Sanid is hammering and crafting a sword during her job as a blacksmith. After a long day of working hard you don't realize how much time has passed, it is past dark, twilight, and you are excited to go back home to your family. You bade farewell to your father who also works late at night and forgets the time and make the walk back home. You can feel a disturbance or disbalance in the World. While you are still far from home, you begin to run. You were feeling off for a reason. There, lying in a pool of blood lays a body. You don't even have to go closer to find out who it is. You begin to weap, your whole world shaken. You will find the person responsible and get revenge.
