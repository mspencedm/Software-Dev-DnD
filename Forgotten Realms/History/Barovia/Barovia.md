# Barovia

## Summary

Barovia was taken over from Count Strahd von Zarovich 50 years ago - they are now celebrating their freedom celebration.

### **The New Barovia: A Reborn Land**

#### **Historical Context**
Fifty years ago, the infamous vampire lord Strahd von Zarovich was defeated by a group of courageous adventurers. Among them was a noble dwarf knight, Dame Ragna Bronzehammer, whose unyielding spirit and unmatched skill in battle led the charge against Strahd. With the vampire lord's defeat, the Dark Powers that once gripped Barovia lost their influence, and the oppressive mists that had trapped the land for centuries began to dissipate. Barovia was no longer isolated; it was now connected to the world beyond, particularly to Waterdeep, via the Ethereal Plane.

#### **The Reign of House Bronzehammer**
In the aftermath of Strahd’s fall, Dame Ragna Bronzehammer was declared the new ruler of Barovia. Alongside her human husband, Sir Alaric, who had fought by her side, they took on the monumental task of rebuilding the land. Under Ragna's leadership and Alaric's guidance, the once foreboding Castle Ravenloft was claimed by the Bronzehammer family. Over the years, the castle was meticulously redecorated and restored, transforming it from a symbol of terror into a beacon of hope and justice. It was fittingly renamed **Castle Bronzehammer**.

Ragna and Alaric’s union brought together the strengths of their two peoples, and their legacy continues through their son, **Bromir Bronzehammer**, who is now the current ruler of Barovia. Bromir, inheriting the fierce determination of his mother and the noble heart of his father, has continued the work of his parents, guiding Barovia through its ongoing recovery and transformation.

Bromir is married to **Lyris** (a human woman from Waterdeep), whose grace and wisdom have made her a beloved figure in Barovia. Together, they have two children: their eldest daughter, **Mira**, a bright and adventurous 5-year-old who shows signs of both her grandmother's warrior spirit and her father's leadership, and their infant son, **Darin**, who is still in his crib but already holds the hopes of his family for the future.

#### **Barovia’s Connection to Waterdeep**
Barovia, still touched by the ethereal, maintains a unique connection to Waterdeep. The Ethereal Plane serves as a bridge, allowing trade, communication, and even travel between the two lands. This connection has been vital for Barovia's reconstruction, bringing in resources and expertise from the bustling city of Waterdeep. Despite this newfound connection, Barovia remains distinct—a land of ancient forests, misty mountains, and deep-rooted traditions, now free from the oppressive shadow of its past.

#### **Castle Bronzehammer**
Perched on the cliffs overlooking the village below, Castle Bronzehammer has become a symbol of the new Barovia. Once a place of darkness and despair, it is now filled with grand halls, intricately carved stonework, and tapestries depicting the valor and victories of the Bronzehammer family. Ragna’s dwarven heritage is evident throughout the castle, with strong, enduring architecture and a focus on craftsmanship that reflects the resilience of her people.

The castle serves not only as the seat of power but also as a center for governance, culture, and learning. The Bronzehammer family has opened parts of the castle to the public, transforming it into a place where the people of Barovia can gather, learn, and celebrate their newfound freedom.

#### **The Rebuilding of Barovia**
Under the Bronzehammer rule, Barovia has slowly but steadily rebuilt itself. Villages and towns that once cowered in fear under Strahd's rule are now thriving communities. The people of Barovia, though still wary and haunted by their past, are beginning to believe in a brighter future. Trade routes have opened, agriculture has flourished, and the arts and crafts of Barovia are beginning to be recognized and appreciated beyond its borders.

Barovia's connection to Waterdeep has brought new opportunities, but it has also presented challenges. The Bronzehammer family, now led by Bromir, carefully navigates the delicate balance between maintaining Barovia’s unique identity and integrating with the wider world. Bromir, embodying the best of both his parents, continues to uphold the Bronzehammer legacy, ensuring that Barovia remains a land of resilience, honor, and hope.

### **Conclusion**
Fifty years after Strahd’s defeat, Barovia is a land in transition—a place where the past and present intermingle, and where the future is being carefully shaped by those who have inherited the mantle of leadership. Castle Bronzehammer stands as a monument to the triumph of light over darkness, and the people of Barovia, under the guidance of the Bronzehammer family, continue their journey toward a prosperous and peaceful future.
