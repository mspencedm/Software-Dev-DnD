# Castle Bronzehammer

### **Castle Bronzehammer: A Beacon of Resilience and Renewal**

Perched atop the rocky cliffs overlooking the village of Barovia, Castle Bronzehammer stands as a testament to the enduring spirit and unyielding strength of the Bronzehammer family. Once known as Castle Ravenloft, the fortress was a symbol of fear and tyranny under the rule of Strahd von Zarovich. Now, after decades of transformation and careful restoration, it has become a beacon of hope and renewal, reflecting the values and heritage of its new rulers.

#### **Exterior Architecture**
Castle Bronzehammer’s exterior is a striking blend of dwarven craftsmanship and the castle’s original Gothic architecture. The ancient stone walls, once cold and foreboding, have been reinforced and polished, their surfaces now gleaming in the daylight with intricate carvings that depict the victories of Dame Ragna Bronzehammer and her ancestors. The battlements are adorned with statues of dwarven warriors, each one crafted with meticulous detail, standing as eternal guardians over the castle.

The main entrance is a grand, arched gate made of solid ironwood, banded with steel and embossed with the sigil of House Bronzehammer—a hammer striking an anvil, surrounded by a ring of mountain peaks. Flanking the gate are two towering statues of Ragna and Alaric Bronzehammer, their likenesses captured in stone, welcoming all who enter with a sense of reverence and pride.

Instead of gargoles, the statues on pedestals at the entrance are griffons.

The castle’s spires, once shrouded in darkness, now reach toward the sky with a sense of purpose. The highest tower, known as the **Watcher’s Spire**, serves as a lookout, offering a panoramic view of the surrounding lands. The spire is topped with a beacon that shines brightly at night, guiding travelers and symbolizing the light that has returned to Barovia.

#### **The Courtyard**
Upon passing through the main gate, visitors are greeted by a sprawling courtyard that has been transformed into a lush garden. The once barren and desolate space is now filled with vibrant greenery, with meticulously maintained flower beds, dwarf fruit trees, and a central fountain carved from white marble. The fountain, which features a depiction of a roaring dragon—the sigil of the Bronzehammer family—spouts crystal-clear water that flows into a circular basin.

The courtyard is a place of gathering and reflection, where the people of Barovia can come to seek solace, share stories, and pay their respects to the Bronzehammer family. It is also the site of various festivals and ceremonies, celebrating the resilience of Barovia’s people and the victories that have been won.

#### **The Great Hall**
Stepping through the massive double doors of ironwood, one enters the **Great Hall**—the heart of Castle Bronzehammer. The hall is a magnificent space, with high, vaulted ceilings supported by massive stone pillars. The walls are adorned with tapestries depicting the history of the Bronzehammer family, from their origins in the dwarven strongholds to their triumph over Strahd. The central tapestry, the largest and most detailed, shows Ragna Bronzehammer leading the charge against the vampire lord, hammer raised high.

The floor is made of polished granite, its surface inlaid with veins of gold and silver that form intricate patterns. A massive hearth dominates one wall, its roaring fire providing warmth and light to the hall. Above the hearth hangs a banner bearing the sigil of House Bronzehammer, flanked by the crossed battle-axes of Ragna herself.

At the far end of the hall stands the **Throne of Barovia**, a grand seat carved from a single block of obsidian. The throne is adorned with the same dwarven craftsmanship that defines the rest of the castle, with runes of protection and strength inscribed along its surface. The throne is a symbol of the authority and responsibility that comes with ruling Barovia, and it is here that Bromir Bronzehammer holds court, hearing the petitions of his people and making decisions that will shape the future of the land.

#### **The Armory**
The **Armory** of Castle Bronzehammer is a treasure trove of weapons and armor, reflecting the martial prowess of the Bronzehammer family. The room is lined with racks of swords, axes, and hammers, all crafted with the finest dwarven steel. Suits of armor stand at attention along the walls, their surfaces gleaming with the care of skilled craftsmen. The armory also houses a collection of relics from the battle against Strahd, including the very hammer that Ragna used to deliver the final blow to the vampire lord.

#### **The Anvilforge**
One of the most unique features of Castle Bronzehammer is the **Anvilforge**, a dwarven forge built deep within the castle’s foundations. The forge is a place of creation and innovation, where master smiths work tirelessly to craft weapons, armor, and tools for the Bronzehammer family and the people of Barovia. The Anvilforge is equipped with the latest in dwarven technology, including a series of bellows and furnaces that are capable of reaching temperatures sufficient to melt even the hardest of metals.

The forge is also a place of ceremony, where important events, such as the forging of a new weapon for the ruling family, are marked with rituals and blessings from the dwarven gods. The Anvilforge is a testament to the dwarven roots of the Bronzehammer family and their commitment to the craft of smithing.
