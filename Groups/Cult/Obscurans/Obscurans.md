## Origins
The Obscurans are a secretive and fanatical cult that has its roots in the remnants of the past, during the time of the Arcknights' ascendancy. As the world transformed in the wake of the Tearfall, there were those who refused to accept the Arcknights' teachings and the burgeoning Arventian pantheon. Their fervent rejection of the Arcknights and their belief in the sanctity of a simpler, pre-Tearfall world led to the formation of the Obscurans.

## Core Beliefs
The Obscurans ardently deny the Arventian pantheon, labeling it as a blasphemous falsehood. Their core beliefs include:

## Rejection of Deities
The Obscurans categorically deny the existence of any divine entities, including the Arcknights and their pantheon. They consider the worship of gods and goddesses as delusional and detrimental to progress.

## Pre-Tearfall Ideal
The Obscurans long for a return to the days before the Tearfall, when they believe the world was in a state of pure magic and untainted by technology. They view technological advancements and the blending of magic and machinery as abominations that corrupted the world.

## Destruction of Arventia
The ultimate goal of the Obscurans is the complete eradication of the Arventian way of life. They believe that only through the annihilation of the Arcknights, their followers, and the beliefs of Arventia can they restore the world to its "true" state.

## Activities and Practices
The Obscurans engage in various activities aimed at undermining the Arcknights and their influence:

### Infiltration
Cult members often infiltrate Arcknights' society, posing as ordinary citizens or even scholars. They gather information on Arventian developments and followers to target.

### Sabotage
The Obscurans engage in acts of sabotage, targeting advanced technology, magical experiments, and divine ceremonies. Their goal is to disrupt Arventian progress and create chaos.

### Propaganda
The cult disseminates anti-Arventian propaganda, spreading messages of disbelief and mistrust in the Arcknights. They use clandestine means to undermine the teachings of the Arventian pantheon.

### Violence
The most extreme members of the Obscurans resort to violence, carrying out attacks on Arcknights and their followers. They see themselves as warriors against what they perceive as a heretical belief system.

### Leadership
The leadership of the Obscurans is cloaked in secrecy. A council of high-ranking members, known as the "Doubters," makes key decisions and sets the cult's direction. The identity of the Doubters is known only to the cult's inner circle, making it difficult for outsiders to target their leadership.

### Rivalry with the Arcknights
The Obscurans' actions have created a bitter and dangerous rivalry with the Arcknights. The Arcknights, committed to balance and progress, seek to protect their beliefs and society from the destructive influence of the Obscurans. This rivalry has led to a constant struggle for the soul of Arventia, with the Obscurans willing to go to great lengths to achieve their goal of eradicating Arventian beliefs.
