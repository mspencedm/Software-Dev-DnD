Control Over Society: While not openly controlling society, the Coinfire Consortium wields significant influence behind the scenes, especially within the circles of wealth and power. They have a network of informants and allies in key positions, allowing them to manipulate events to their advantage.

Guild Activities: The guild's activities are diverse and expansive, ranging from high-stakes heists and elaborate cons to espionage and information brokering. They specialize in acquiring wealth and influence, often through less-than-legal means, while maintaining an air of discretion and sophistication.

Security Measures: The Gilded Vault is protected by layers of magical wards and traps, as well as highly skilled guards trained in both combat and subterfuge. Access to the vault is strictly controlled, and intruders face swift and severe consequences.

Information Gathering: The Coinfire Consortium employs a network of spies, informants, and thieves with keen ears and sharp eyes. They gather information through covert surveillance, infiltration, and manipulation of rival organizations.

Controlled Assets: In addition to their hidden headquarters, the guild controls a network of safehouses, front businesses, and contacts throughout the city. They also have access to a vast array of resources, including skilled craftsmen, forgers, and alchemists.

Conditions of Entry: Prospective members must prove their skill and loyalty through a series of tests and trials. They must demonstrate proficiency in stealth, thievery, and diplomacy, as well as a willingness to put the interests of the guild above their own.

Rogue Activities: Members of the Coinfire Consortium may be tasked with a variety of missions, including heists, sabotage, espionage, and assassination. They may also be called upon to gather information, forge alliances, or eliminate rival threats to the guild's dominance.
