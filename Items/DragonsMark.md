# Dragon's Mark

You get a mark by the Red Dragon that will give you the ability to communicate all the time with other party members. Only one person can communicate through this channel at one time (similar to a radio) but its a 1:1 connection. The captain chosen can always override the current communication but other people if the line is busy their message won't go through. It's easy for party members to use they just have to check to see if the line is open (will hear rushing wind sound) and send a message - if they try to connect and there is no rushing wind sound the line is currently closed or in use. Captain can always override but the other message being transmitted will immediately drop. Captain can send out an announcement so everyone can hear it. Have players come up with hand signal system. Red dragon can always override.
