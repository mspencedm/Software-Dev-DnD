## Summary 

List of Shards and their deity

There are 10 shards, each one created by a deity. 

## Plot

The idea is going to be a shard hunt. Everyone is going to want a shard and for a different reason. Going to need to start working that into the plot. But all the different deity groups want the shard created by their deity - tasked with watching over it. 

The Obscurans want all the shards to give to Morthos because he wants to use them all to reset the World and become a god. 

The acolytes want the shard for their deity as a way to show respect/follow their god. 

Give players personal reasons to want shards outside of just preventing Morthos. Also, shards have incredible power.
