### **Tear of the Bound Realms**

**Wondrous Item (requires attunement)**

**Description:**  
The **Tear of the Bound Realms** is a crystalline orb, approximately the size of a large apple, with a smooth, pearlescent surface that shimmers in hues of red, gold, and black. It radiates a faint, otherworldly glow, and its inner depths seem to shift and swirl with a misty, ever-changing light. The orb is encased in an intricate frame of dark metal, engraved with ancient draconic runes and symbols.

**Properties:**

1. **Planar Travel:**  
   Once attuned, the Tear allows its user to open rifts between planes of existence. By touching the orb with their bare skin and concentrating, the user can create a portal to a different plane. The destination must be known to the user, and the portal remains open for up to 10 minutes before closing.

2. **Attunement Requirements:**  
   To attune to the Tear, the user must make physical contact with it, holding it in their hand for a period of 1 hour. The orb will only attune to individuals who have their skin directly touching it throughout the attunement process.

3. **Transfer of Ownership:**  
   The Tear of the Bound Realms can only be transferred to a new owner with the permission of its creator, Cloud Cutter. The dragon’s approval is granted through a magical ritual known only to the dragon and those it chooses. Without this permission, any attempt to attune to the Tear by someone other than its current bearer will fail, and the Tear will resist any attempts to forcefully change attunement.

4. **Enhanced Planar Awareness:**  
   While attuned, the user gains a heightened awareness of planar boundaries and can sense the proximity of planar rifts within a 1-mile radius. This ability allows them to detect other planar disturbances or travelers.

5. **Draconic Bond:**  
   The Tear is imbued with a fragment of Cloud Cutter’s essence. As such, the attuned user may sometimes experience fleeting visions or whispers related to the dragon’s thoughts or desires. This bond also grants the user advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when dealing with dragons or dragon-related entities.

**Cursed Property (Optional):**  
If the Tear is ever stolen or misused without Cloud Cutter’s permission, it may react with a powerful curse. This could manifest as a dragon's wrath, planar instability affecting the user, or a loss of control over the orb’s power, potentially leading to dangerous planar anomalies.

**Lore:**  
Created by Cloud Cutter, a powerful red dragon known for his mastery over planar magic, the Tear of the Bound Realms was crafted to serve as a conduit between worlds, a tool for espionage and manipulation. The orb reflects the dragon's own desire for control and dominion over multiple planes.
