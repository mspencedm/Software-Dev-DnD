## Current Happenings and Notes

### Cutbacks

The city will announce that they will be paying half their usual price for items looted in the forst - much harder if not near impossible to make a good living on that. 

Repurcussions I'm sure will occur


### The Rumor

Rumors about stuff getting stolen continue.

As far as werewolves, no one knows anything about them. At all. Completely stumped.

### The Arcane Academy's Secret

The Arcane Academy is secretly researching the cure to werewolf bites and stopping people from turning into werewolves. Tests so far have been unsuccessful but it's hard to figure out since they all become werewolves.

Notable Feature The lighthouse at the entrance of the port is enchanted, casting a mesmerizing aurora-like display over the waves, guiding ships safely to the harbor.

### Ship to the Tempest's Maw

Players can either rent a ship and try to sail themselves (or use their merecenary for hire) or they can pay someone else to take them there.

Usually, a boat wouldn't be too expensive since it's not too far from shore but considering the dangerous mission and waters, people are upcharging or they are desperate. 

1 sp a day per head to rent a keelboat.

2 sp a day per head to rent a sailboat.
