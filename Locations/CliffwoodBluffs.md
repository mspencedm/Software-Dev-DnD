# Cliffwood Bluffs

## Summary
The Cliffwood Bluffs lie to the east of Aurora's Heart, a rugged expanse of towering cliffs and dense forest that stretches as far as the eye can see. The cliffs rise dramatically from the forest floor, their sheer faces weathered by the elements over countless ages. The cliffs surround the forest on both sides. Facing the forest (east), there's a break between the cliffs known as Cliffwood Pass which the road travels along. On the right side (south) is a cliff and on the left side (north) there is another cliff.

The forest surrounding the Cliffwood Bluffs teems with life, its ancient trees standing sentinel over a realm of untamed wilderness. Sunlight filters through the canopy above, dappling the forest floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow. Birds call out from hidden perches, their melodic songs echoing through the trees, while small creatures scurry about in the underbrush.

A network of winding trails and hidden pathways crisscrosses the forest, offering adventurers the chance to explore its hidden depths and uncover its secrets. From the cliff's edge, one can gaze out across the sprawling landscape, where the distant horizon fades into the hazy blue distance. At sunrise and sunset, the cliffs are bathed in the warm hues of the sun, casting long shadows that stretch out across the forest below.

But amid the beauty of the Cliffwood Bluffs lies danger, for the rugged terrain and dense foliage harbor creatures both mundane and magical. Wolves prowl the forest depths, their eyes gleaming with predatory hunger, while ancient spirits and fey creatures are said to dwell within the hidden groves and shadowed hollows. Those who dare to venture into the Cliffwood Bluffs must tread carefully, for the forest holds both beauty and peril in equal measure.

Layout: The camp consists of a cluster of makeshift structures crafted from fallen branches, moss-covered logs, and scavenged materials. These include rough-hewn shelters for sleeping, a central meeting area with a fire pit for cooking and warmth, and hidden lookout posts perched high in the treetops.

Decorations: The camp is adorned with stolen trinkets, trophies, and symbols of their exploits, including tattered banners, stolen valuables, and the bones of defeated foes. These serve as reminders of their victories and fuel their sense of rebellion against authority.
