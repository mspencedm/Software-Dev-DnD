## Summary
The Cliffwood Bluffs lie to the east of Aurora's Heart, a rugged expanse of towering cliffs and dense forest that stretches as far as the eye can see. The cliffs rise dramatically from the forest floor, their sheer faces weathered by the elements over countless ages. The cliffs surround the forest on both sides. Facing the forest (east), there's a break between the cliffs known as Cliffwood Pass which the road travels along. On the right side (south) is a cliff and on the left side (north) there is another cliff.

The forest surrounding the Cliffwood Bluffs teems with life, its ancient trees standing sentinel over a realm of untamed wilderness. Sunlight filters through the canopy above, dappling the forest floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow. Birds call out from hidden perches, their melodic songs echoing through the trees, while small creatures scurry about in the underbrush.

A network of winding trails and hidden pathways crisscrosses the forest, offering adventurers the chance to explore its hidden depths and uncover its secrets. From the cliff's edge, one can gaze out across the sprawling landscape, where the distant horizon fades into the hazy blue distance. At sunrise and sunset, the cliffs are bathed in the warm hues of the sun, casting long shadows that stretch out across the forest below.

But amid the beauty of the Cliffwood Bluffs lies danger, for the rugged terrain and dense foliage harbor creatures both mundane and magical. Wolves prowl the forest depths, their eyes gleaming with predatory hunger, while ancient spirits and fey creatures are said to dwell within the hidden groves and shadowed hollows. Those who dare to venture into the Cliffwood Bluffs must tread carefully, for the forest holds both beauty and peril in equal measure.


## Random Encounters

Random Encounters in the Cliffwood Bluffs - just kind of nesteled anywhere in the forest - it's going to be a super thick and deep forest - lots of adventures to be had. Basically if players are just wandering around or not acting, random encounter. Feel free to just use these random encounters over and over with slight variance. 

### Wolf Encounter

Wolf Encounter

Just wolves attacking - nothing special just kind of a wild as they are going kind of attack


### Kobold Camp

Kobold Encounter

Just going to be pretty scrappy a couple of tents, mostly them just hanging about. 

I'll allow the party to find like 10 copper pieces, basically nothing. Very unsuccessful people here. 


### Bandit Camp

Bandit Camp Encounter

We will have this be a harder encounter with some actually challenging people. We will see if party keeps them alive or just kills everyone. We will also have them release beasts onto the party.

I'll allow the party to find like 50 silver pieces on them, so still not great but a bit more success. I want the majority of the money earned from this to be from the kingdom, where hopefully they are smart or they will learn that they need proof. 


### Lions, Tigers, Bears Oh My!

Random Encounter

Variety of animals attack them - just kind of thrown in these random attacks as you go




## Right Side (South Cliffs)

Bandits are hiding out in these caves


Have the cave be pretty well disguised - no guard - trusting in the disguise and hiding. 

Wooden door blocked by bushes. 

Magical door - write secret password to open. 

Sign on the right that says

STOP! Remember to write the secret password on the door before attempting to open (don't want to loose any more fingers)

Playeres can try to catch a thief in town/find one (people keep losing stuff)

Search around - note hidden underneath the mat that gives the password 

Password: shadowblade

further investigation will reveal that there is no magic binding the door

Bandit Group:

These people are now part of the party helping Ezekiel attack the village

Leader:

Name: Kaelen Shadowblade

Bandit Members:

Name: Rook Blackthorn

Name: Sab Nightshade [ X ]

Name: Asher Nightshade [ X ]

Name: Ember Darkwood

Name: Raven Shadowcloak [ - ]

Name: Talon Swiftstrike

Name: Willow Whisperwind [ X ]

Name: Vex Emberheart

These young bandits operate in the shadows of the forest, using their agility, stealth, and cunning to outmaneuver their enemies and evade capture. Led by Kaelen Shadowblade, they are a tight-knit group bound together by their shared thirst for adventure and desire for freedom.

They refer to each other by their last names - which they made up for themselves. 


Open the door to the bandit camp in the cliff. Wide open room with several smaller rooms. In front is what appears to be an alter but its has a pillow and blanket like someone has been sleeping on it. Behind the alter is a statue of a man of shadows - Ezekiel will recognize this is Morthos. 

The camp is huge with lots of rooms and its filled with trinkets, but also branches etc. very makeshift lots of blankets and things. 

Kids are running around in the camp, having fun. 

People inside are going to be shocked by the party entering, will kind of just look at them and look guilty like they've been busted.

Leader is going to be pretty defensive about the whole thing - gang started because the kids needed places to go etc. Leader will occassionally have his eyes flash black completely and turn back to normal - see if players notice while conversing with him. He will let everyone else leave but he will not be reasoned with - he will continue being a thief etc. dedicated to living. 


Layout: The camp consists of a cluster of makeshift structures crafted from fallen branches, moss-covered logs, and scavenged materials. These include rough-hewn shelters for sleeping, a central meeting area with a fire pit for cooking and warmth, and hidden lookout posts perched high in the treetops.

Decorations: The camp is adorned with stolen trinkets, trophies, and symbols of their exploits, including tattered banners, stolen valuables, and the bones of defeated foes. These serve as reminders of their victories and fuel their sense of rebellion against authority.



## Left Side (North Cliffs)

Apostates from the Cult of Obscurans are hiding out in these caves

Outside of this cave there is going to be food planted and animals hanging as food storage etc. Clearly going to look like a community has been developing here, but a hidden one. 

There are going to be people tending the gardens - big community. Someone is standing guard - definitely well lived - we will say like 40 or so people here, including women and children.

They have lots of tents outside pitched. 

They will definitely be aprehensive of the party as they approach, will not attack immediately, but will be very interested in why they are there.

Brought to bit tent where leader is.

Large cave - well lived with several rooms. Most of it seems to be used for storage. 


### Camp

Leader:

Name: Elias Brightwater
Description: Elias is a compassionate and steadfast man in his late thirties, with warm, earnest eyes that reflect his unwavering commitment to his people. He exudes a calm and reassuring presence, inspiring trust and confidence in those around him. As the leader of the apostate community, he guides them with wisdom and compassion, seeking to build a better future for all.


Second-in-Command:

Name: Thorne Darkwood
Description: Thorne is a seasoned warrior in his forties, with a rugged demeanor and a stern countenance that belies a heart of gold. He is fiercely loyal to Elias and commands respect with his unwavering dedication to protecting their community.


### Voice

"This is the place. End them all." 

Morthos will say this to Ezekiel. 


They will talk about how they are apostates to the Obscurans - they don't believe in the arcknights - consider themselves athiests to any religion and are focused solely on survival - survivalists. 

I mean if there was a higher power they certainly don't care about us there are so many troubles in the World.


Women and children - community established. Guards - etc. basically a small village living in this forest area. 

We would rather live out the rest of our lives here in these woods avoiding the judgemental stares. 



### The Decision

#### Werewolf Encounter

Werewolves live here


#### North Cliff Camp Encounter

Ezekiel decides to listen to Morthos and the party attacks the people here. It should be an easy combat but still there's a lot of them so something to keep in mind for sure as there's lot of numbers and they are fighting for their life. Many will surrender. 

Going to do Horde Rules here but basically we are going to put to put 8 soldiers to make it a hard encounter since they will get a lot of attacks but we are going to make the people easy to cut through - easy to kill.

Man guarding the cave - most "decorated" soldier of this group

Give him like 35hp

Other 2 more capable soldiers like 20hp

Cave soldier - 14hp\



#### Seraphina

One of the villagers will be Seraphina - oohhh she will be the woman trying to hide the child. Around her neck is going to be the yellow shard of dissolution. She won't go down without a fight. 


##### The Baby

Sometime whether near the end of the battle within the cave they will hear a cry. There inside is a woman trying to hide with her child underneath some blankets. If they are continuing the killing streak, they will also have to kill this child.

The child is going to be a young boy probably less than 1 like 8 months. He will be crying, swadled in a blue blanket. 

Will Ezekiel kill the child? 


#### Aftermath

Everyone is dead. If players keep the child alive - Morthos will punish Ezekiel - Morthos's Arm.

If they decide to kill the child, then Morthos will tell Ezekiel he did a good job and to await the next thing, because he still has more work for him.

Loot - if they do kill everyone I will reward the players generous. With everyone there, they certainly aren't rich, I'll say they find 1200 gold pieces which they can freely divide amongst themselves - if players are looting more than others individually I'll let individual players find it. 

They don't find any magical items or anything too special, mostly just supplies - so if they wanted any survival supplies - rope etc. this would be the time. 


#### Morthos's Revenge

Ezekiel decides not to listen to Morthos and defies him - Morthos will send shadow monsters after the party and the people in the cliffs.
These shadow monsters will also be encountered in a horde style.

This is going to be the harder encounter - players may be downed - lots of people in the camp will die. Shadows will primarily attack Ezekiel. If he is downed, rather than killing him fully, they will take his arm. Replace it with a Shadow Arm - Morthos's Arm for Morthos's Servant.


##### The Baby

If some of the shadow monsters get into the cave the baby is going to be attacked - first its mother will be attacked and then the child.


#### Aftermath

Shadows will not have any loot. Morthos will be rightfully angry at Ezekiel but will "spare his life" for now but will not tolerate such disobedience in the future. He will be punished. 
Replace arm with Morthos's Arm - shadow arm - make it dramatic somehow - portal maybe? 

Show the power of Morthos.
