## Summary

A patch of water located 10-15 miles outside of Arventia that spans for about 3 miles in all directions because people haven't been able to pinpoint the problem. Actually host to an underground dungeon, the Tempest's Maw Dungeon. The players are going to have to find this dungeon.


## Finding the Dungeon

Finding the dungeon is going to be a bit of a challenge. However, if the players look down closely through the water they will begin to see an essence of things shining in the light. Additionally, if they ask around town, there will be rumors that items are underwater.

With some more investigation, players will see a big, dark spot in the water and can realize it is a building. 

They will have to swim down to the entrance. See Player Abilities to view underwater breathing rules. See SwimSpeed file to calculate how far a character can swim.

We will say the ocean is 50 feet deep to the bottom for easy math.
