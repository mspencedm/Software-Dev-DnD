## Summary

A patch of water located 10-15 miles outside of Arventia that spans for about 3 miles in all directions because people haven't been able to pinpoint the problem. Actually host to an underground dungeon, the Tempest's Maw Dungeon. The players are going to have to find this dungeon.


## Finding the Dungeon

Finding the dungeon is going to be a bit of a challenge. However, if the players look down closely through the water they will begin to see an essence of things shining in the light. Additionally, if they ask around town, there will be rumors that items are underwater.

With some more investigation, players will see a big, dark spot in the water and can realize it is a building. 

They will have to swim down to the entrance. See Player Abilities to view underwater breathing rules. See SwimSpeed file to calculate how far a character can swim.

We will say the ocean is 50 feet deep to the bottom for easy math. 


### Entrance Puzzle

The entrance is open to the Tempest's Maw and on the ground of the first room reads the words:

"Enter the belly of the beast
Get swallowed whole you are the feast
But filled with water is the mouth
And the path ahead to the south
Will open when the water is gone
Beware, you are not alone."


Beyond that deeper into the room you see that there is a message engraved on the door. Below the inscripted message you see the words ANSWER and below it on the floor is a rectangle filled with magic sand that somehow is not getting wet.

It reads:

Waves crash upon shores, with a rhythmic beat,
A source of life, pure and sweet.
The gentle rain that softly falls,
Endless currents in constant devotion.
Rivers wind through valleys, their courses they carve.

What am I?


Players write the word Water into the sand. 

Players will have to swim back up to think about it.

With a successful answer, the water will drain from the room. Once the water is drained. the door will close and an ominous sound will echo. 

The door will stop glowing and you players will hear a click as it unlocks.


If players fail to write the correct word, a whirlpool will begin in the room, spinning around. This will also drain the room, but players will take 1d10 of damage. The above will still occur.
