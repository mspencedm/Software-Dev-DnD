## Summary

A patch of water located 10-15 miles outside of Arventia that spans for about 3 miles in all directions because people haven't been able to pinpoint the problem. Actually host to an underground dungeon, the Tempest's Maw Dungeon. The players are going to have to find this dungeon.


## Finding the Dungeon

Finding the dungeon is going to be a bit of a challenge. However, if the players look down closely through the water they will begin to see an essence of things shining in the light. Additionally, if they ask around town, there will be rumors that items are underwater.

With some more investigation, players will see a big, dark spot in the water and can realize it is a building. 

They will have to swim down to the entrance. See Player Abilities to view underwater breathing rules. See SwimSpeed file to calculate how far a character can swim.

We will say the ocean is 50 feet deep to the bottom for easy math. 


### Entrance Puzzle

The entrance is open to the Tempest's Maw and on the ground of the first room reads the words:

"Enter the belly of the beast
Get swallowed whole you are the feast
But filled with water is the mouth
And the path ahead to the south
Will open when the water is gone
Beware, you are not alone."


Beyond that deeper into the room you see that there is a message engraved on the door. Below the inscripted message you see the words ANSWER and below it on the floor is a rectangle filled with magic sand that somehow is not getting wet.

It reads:

Waves crash upon shores, with a rhythmic beat,
A source of life, pure and sweet.
The gentle rain that softly falls,
Endless currents in constant devotion.
Rivers wind through valleys, their courses they carve.

What am I?


Players write the word Water into the sand. 

Players will have to swim back up to think about it.

With a successful answer, the water will drain from the room. Once the water is drained. the door will close and an ominous sound will echo. If anyone knows Draconic, they will hear that the actual large noise is saying "Help Me"

The door will stop glowing and you players will hear a click as it unlocks.


If players fail to write the correct word, a whirlpool will begin in the room, spinning around. This will also drain the room, but players will take 1d10 of damage. The above will still occur.



## Main Room

As the door opens, you see another group of 4 adventurers there. You also see that it is a fairly big but empty room. However, there is another door to the left and right and stiars that seem to lead down further into the deep. 


### Stormtide Marauders


They used to be pirates whose ship sunk so they had to enter to survive. The door shut and they got stuck, just hoping someone would come rescue them.

Meet the Stormtide Marauders, a band of adventurers forged in the crucible of the high seas. Once notorious pirates feared throughout the realm, they now find themselves trapped within the depths of a treacherous dungeon, their former glory a distant memory. Thorn Brightleaf, Lyra Stormsong, Grimm Ironfist, and Sylphie Whisperwind, former captains and crewmates of the infamous pirate ship The Storm's Echo, now seek to reclaim their freedom and redeem their tarnished reputations. Though their days of plunder and pillage are behind them, the spirit of adventure still burns bright within their hearts as they face the challenges of their newfound quest. Together, they are the Stormtide Marauders, determined to weather any storm and emerge victorious once more.

Thorn Brightleaf: A roguish halfling with nimble fingers and a quick wit. Thorn was exploring the dungeon in search of treasure when the door slammed shut behind him, leaving him stranded. Despite his misfortune, Thorn's optimism and resourcefulness have kept the group's spirits high.

Lyra Stormsong: A determined human cleric devoted to the goddess of the sea. Lyra embarked on her quest to cleanse the dungeon of dark forces but found herself ensnared by its traps. With her healing magic and unwavering faith, she provides hope to her companions in their darkest moments.

Grimm Ironfist: A grizzled dwarven warrior with a heart of gold. Grimm's strength and resilience have kept the group safe from the dungeon's many dangers. Though he longs for the open sky and a hearty meal, he remains steadfast in his determination to find a way out.

Sylphie Whisperwind: An elven mage with a deep connection to nature. Sylphie's mastery of arcane magic has proven invaluable in navigating the dungeon's labyrinthine passages. While she misses the tranquility of the forest, she finds solace in the camaraderie of her companions.

They will not really want to stay and talk to the party. They will inform them that they didn't notice anything unusual, but sometimes felt like there was something watching them, but they didn't explore just tried to survive. They will keep trying to leave unless the players can convince them to stay.



## Right Room

You enter the right side room and notice it is quite dark, practically impossible to see anything.

There will be panels on the floor and if the players keep walking in the dark, if they trigger a panel an arrow will shoot out at them - 1d4 damage.

If they are able to have darkvision or use light, they can see there are tile panels on the ground. Some of the tiles have waves while others have pictures of palm trees. Players will easily be able to figure out that waves will cause arrows to fly at them while the land tiles are fine to stand on.

Making there way across the room, there will be an empty pedestal. On the pedeestal, words are glowing and it reads:

"What you provide, water will bring alive"

If someone touches the pedestal, they will begin to glow and the power of water will be upon them. They gain advantage on everything until they take a long rest.

If someone puts someone dead on the pedestal, they will be revived back to life. If someone puts someone sick or ill, they will be healed.

If someone puts money or something else of only monetary value, it will be tripled in amount.

Once the pedestal is used, it will stop glowing. It will no longer work.



## Left Room

You enter the room and it is dimly lit and hard to see in the room. However, you hear a croaking noise and hear the sound of a slither moving the water. Looking you can see some giant toads and a mersnake man coming towards to attack you - roll initiative!

These enemies have darkvision. So players will need to figure out a light source or have darkvision or will have disadvantage on attacks. (dimly lit room)

Once players defeat and can explore the room, they will notice there's not much to this room. However, there is a chest that is glowing in the back of the room, covered with some moss and seaweed.

Chest is a mimic. If players don't check, they will get bitten - should be a quick encounter. 

After players defeat the mimic, doing some searching they will find 10 pieces of silver or so around the room.



## Down the stairs

As you go down the stairs you enter into a big room. Once down the stairs, you step on some weird terrain as there are spikes sticking up from the wood in a few spots. 

You see some giant octopus, some merfolk, and some sea hags gathered in the room, all of them hitting the spikes. However, when they see you, they attack. Roll for initiative.


## Aftermath

After the players defeat all the enemies, they will feel they are beginning to move up in the water. They will then be tilted down as they lose their footing and the room is flooded back with water. They will be lifted out of the water and will hit it with a splash. They will witness the wooden structure they were on crashing down into the depths below. 

"Thank you" (if they understand draconic) or a loud echo will sound.

They will see, in full form, a giant dragon turtle. You recognize the spikes being the spikes you saw within the wooden structure. The dragon turtle is absolutely giant. He will begin swimming away.


Players will have to navigate back. If they can speak draconic and talk to the dragon turtle, he will offer them a ride back close to shore.


### Payment

Players will need to go back and report to the castle. They probably did not take anything off the dragon turtle or think of it. They will have to convince the castle what they saw and what happened. If they fully believe them, they will pay right away. If not, they will wait a few days to make sure trade has gone down and then pay them.
