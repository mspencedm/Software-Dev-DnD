[Sheet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/123326554)

## Description

Finn Tidecaller is a water genasi with cerulean skin and hair that flows like seaweed in the current. His eyes shimmer with a watery hue, and his presence is accompanied by the faint scent of saltwater. Tall and lean, Finn moves with the fluid grace of the ocean, and his voice carries the lulling cadence of waves crashing against the shore.


## Key Information

Finn is young, especially for a captain, at only 27 years old. He is well built and very fit. He has an anchor tatto on his right arm shoulder area. He has a mischievous smile. 

He was a captain of a very successful ship, The Swashtrader Waverider. It used to be a pirate ship but we stopped pirating and decided to do honest work, trade. But that was a mistake since now trade is down. My crew left me to go continue pirating but I wanted something more and better. 

Of course, I have to eat. So now I'm a mercenary for hire. 6GP a day. What do you say? I'll even throw in my sailing skills, free of charge.



## Backstory

Once a notorious pirate captain, Finn Tidecaller now roams the seas as a freelance mercenary, offering his nautical expertise to the highest bidder. Born and raised on the open ocean, Finn has always felt a deep connection to the sea, and his mastery of maritime skills is unmatched. However, a series of betrayals and close encounters with death led Finn to abandon his life of piracy in search of redemption.

## Skills and Abilities

As a seasoned sailor and former pirate captain, Finn possesses a wide array of nautical skills, including navigation, ship handling, and combat at sea. His water genasi heritage grants him enhanced agility and strength while in water, allowing him to navigate treacherous waters with ease and engage in underwater combat when necessary. Finn is also skilled in the use of various weapons, particularly those suited for close-quarters combat aboard a ship, such as cutlasses and boarding pikes. Additionally, Finn has a keen understanding of maritime tactics and strategy, making him a valuable asset in naval engagements and seafaring adventures.
