# Tharivol Silver

## Description
Tharivol Silver is a lean and nimble elf, his silver hair cascading like liquid mercury down his shoulders. His almond-shaped eyes, a shade of deep indigo, gleam with a mischievous glint. Tharivol's attire is a play of shadows and lightâ€”elaborate robes adorned with illusions that shift and shimmer as he moves, reflecting Ludon's whimsical influence.

## Backstory
Born under the canopy of the Wildwood, Tharivol's fascination with illusions and trickery led him to the service of Ludon. As a young acolyte, he honed his skills, mastering the art of weaving shadows and crafting illusions that delighted and confounded. Tharivol's innate connection to the ethereal realms drew the attention of Ludon, who bestowed upon him the mantle of a Trickery Domain cleric.

Tharivol's journey has taken him from the secluded sanctuaries of the Wildwood to the heart of Eldertop, where he now tends to the Lud Hearth. His captivating illusions and insightful guidance have made him a respected figure among Mirthweavers.
