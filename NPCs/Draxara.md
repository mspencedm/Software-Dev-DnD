### **Draxara Voss, The Planar Liaison**

**Appearance:**  
Draxara Voss is a striking figure with an ethereal presence. Standing at just over 6 feet tall, she has an enigmatic beauty marked by features that hint at her otherworldly nature. Her skin has a subtle, iridescent sheen, shifting colors like a pearl when she moves. Her eyes are a piercing amber, reflecting the fiery hues of the dragon she serves. She wears flowing robes of deep crimson and gold, adorned with intricate patterns that shimmer with a faint, magical light.

**Background:**  
Draxara is an enigmatic half-elf with a mysterious past, rumored to have been adopted or transformed by Cloud Cutter, a powerful red dragon. Her role as a liaison is to maintain communication and execute covert operations on behalf of the dragon. Her connections to multiple planes grant her unique capabilities that are invaluable for espionage and sabotage.

**Abilities:**

1. **Planar Travel:** Draxara possesses a rare and powerful artifact known as the **Tear of the Bound Realms**, a crystalline orb that allows her to open rifts between planes. This ability lets her travel to different realms for reconnaissance, escape, or to gather intelligence. She wears this around her neeck - this item is bound to her by touch of skin and will only recognize her.

2. **Illusion and Infiltration:** Skilled in illusion magic, Draxara can alter her appearance and blend into various environments. She can assume different forms, making it difficult for the party to identify her true nature. Her illusions are nearly flawless, making her an adept infiltrator.

3. **Shadow Step:** She can slip into shadows and reappear in a different location within sight, allowing her to move stealthily and evade capture. This ability also helps her traverse between planes discreetly.

4. **Draconic Influence:** Draxara’s connection to Cloud Cutter grants her access to some draconic powers. She can channel minor flame spells and command lesser fire-based creatures to aid her.

5. **Spying Network:** She maintains a network of informants and spies, including enchanted scrying devices and magical creatures, to gather information on the party’s movements and plans.

**Personality:**  
Draxara is cunning and manipulative, with a calm demeanor that belies her ruthless efficiency. She is fiercely loyal to Cloud Cutter, viewing her work as a sacred duty. She employs a blend of charm and intimidation to achieve her goals, and she takes pleasure in outwitting her adversaries. Her intelligence and strategic mind make her a formidable opponent.

**Goals and Motivations:**  
Draxara’s primary goal is to ensure that Cloud Cutter’s plans succeed and to prevent any interference from those who might thwart the dragon’s ambitions. She is driven by a combination of personal loyalty and a deep-seated desire for power and influence.

**Encounter Tips:**
- **Surprise Factor:** Use Draxara’s planar travel and shadow step abilities to create surprise encounters and escapes.
- **Subtle Manipulation:** Have her subtly influence events and sow discord within the party, using her spying network to stay several steps ahead.
- **Ambiguous Motives:** Keep her true motives and identity shrouded in mystery to maintain tension and intrigue.
