## Major Story Points

Seraphina currently posseses the Shard of Dissolution in a Box stolen from the Obscurans. 

The ornate box, discovered by Seraphina in the Sylvan Haven, contains a powerful magical artifact known as the "Shard of Dissolution." This mysterious and dangerous item is a crystalline shard that emanates a faint, ominous glow.

The Obscurans intended to use the Shard of Dissolution to disrupt the harmony of Arventia, causing chaos and erasing the technological and magical advancements that the Arcknights have worked so hard to maintain. The box was meant to transport and conceal the dangerous artifact as it made its way into the hands of those willing to enact the Obscurans' dark plan.


## Description

Race: Half-Elf
Age: 24

### Physical 
Seraphina is a striking half-elf with an air of mystery. Her elven heritage gives her a slender and graceful appearance, while her human blood grants her an approachable demeanor. She has raven-black hair that cascades down her back, framing her piercing emerald-green eyes. She often wears a dark, hooded cloak and carries an ornate dagger with a hilt adorned with Ludon's winking eye symbol.

## Backstory
Seraphina was born to a human mother and an elven father in Eldertop, a city where magic and technology intermingle. From an early age, she displayed a fascination with the mysteries of Arventia and a natural aptitude for both stealth and divine magic. Her talents did not go unnoticed, and she was soon recruited by a small priesthood dedicated to Ludon, the Trickster, and a deep respect for the Arcknights.

One fateful day, Seraphina learned of a dangerous plan by the Obscurans to use the Shard of Dissolution to disrupt the delicate balance of magic and technology in Arventia. Understanding the catastrophic consequences, she knew she had to act. The priesthood entrusted her with a mission to retrieve the stolen artifact, believing that Ludon's guidance could restore harmony.

Equipped with her skills as a cleric of Ludon and an assassin rogue, Seraphina ventured into the underground lairs of the Obscurans, where she uncovered the ornate box containing the Shard of Dissolution. With it in her possession, she now seeks to return it to her priesthood and prevent the imminent calamity it could bring to the City of Celestial Tears.
