# Overall Plot


The Obscurans are a cult that rejects the Arcknights and the belief in the amazingness of a pre-Tearfall worlds.

They are trying to create a better and new World that complete eradicates Arventia because they believe it is the only way to completely eliminate the arcknights. They do not like how heavily the arcknights are relied upon - liability to people. 

We are the Rulers of Our Own Destiny


The second shatter is caused by the Obscurans, specifically one of their high up members Elara. Elara pretends to work at the Feywild bridge to promote the rift between the worlds, but really she does it so she can monitor it best she can.

When she overhears rumors that Seraphina has stolen the Shard of Dissolution, she follows the lead. Not to do her own dirty work, she sends the changeling to pose as Tharivol and receive the Shard peacefully. However, when Seraphina seems to feel that something is off, the changeling takes matters into their own hands and ends Seraphina, disposes of the body quietyly, and takes the shard to deliver to Elara.

Elara delivers the Shard of Dissolution to the Leader of the Obscurans
Plot Twist! 

The Leader of the Obscurans is Lirael Nightbloom - the Council of Verdant Wisdom - Evaluna's Dad

I'm going to have each character have a specific betrayal or relation to the Obscurans

The Changeling I'm going to create and that will be Sanid's SO who "died" but really had to vanish - continually shows up as other characters on their journey but disguise - the ultimate betrayal.

Ezekiel - the god Morthos is not actually a deity of the arcknights - he is a fake deity or "member" who joined after the Tearfall - always incredibly jealous of the original members and the fame they get - uses his influence subtely to rule of the Obscurans even though they don't realize it - their goals align - he wants to reset the World but unlike the Obscurans instead of for their freedom he wants to chain humanity under his divine rule



Morthos corrupts Elara and uses her chained to the Shard of Dissolution to distort it in a way to make the Shard strong enough to shatter all connections to other planes. 

This makes Elara corrupted though and starts to twist her more and more. She has become Morthos kind of personal servant without really knowing it, making her higher and higher up.

At the end, just like Morthos, she is going to betray the Obscurans as the Obscurans don't want the rule of any god while Morthos will betray them to try and claim himself as ruler.
