## Session 1

In the mystical city of Eldertop, our unlikely heroes converged at the Sylvan Haven, a bustling tavern where secrets whisper in every corner. Evaluna, the enigmatic Elf Druid, excused herself for an urgent talk with her father, Lirael Nightbloom, the Guardian of Eldertop.

Meanwhile, Ezekiel Hershberger, a warlock bound by eldritch pacts, and Sanid, the formidable half-orc fighter with a mysterious past, sought employment from Thalindra Leafwhisper. The quest was unveiledâ€”a precious artifact, the Shard of Dissolution, stolen from the Verdant Archive.

Cloaked figures spoke of an ambush, but skepticism lingered in the air. Ezekiel shadowed the hooded figures, discovering a clandestine meeting back at the Sylvan Haven where Sanid, ever vigilant, was approached by a persuasive stranger named Seraphina.

A deal was struck. Distraction ensued, chaos erupted, and the Shard changed hands under the veil of turmoil. Our heroes pursued Seraphina into the night, only to be ambushed outside the city gates by a horde of goblins and vengeful cloaked figures.

In a symphony of blades, spells, and cunning tactics, our party fought valiantly. Bodies fell, mysteries deepened, and as Seraphina vanished into the shadows of the woods, a mysterious encrypted message was uncovered.

As dawn broke, our heroes, battered but victorious, regrouped at the Sylvan Haven. In the morning light, they reunited with Evaluna, only to receive an enigmatic message beckoning them to the Lud Hearth. The stage is set, the plot thickens, and Eldertop holds its secrets close as our adventurers embark on a journey woven with intrigue and danger.


### Serphina and the Box

Seraphina stole the Box from the cloaked figures - the Box contains the [Shard of Dissolution](https://github.com/mspencedm/Arventia/blob/main/Items/ShardOfDissolution.md). 

The ornate box, discovered by Seraphina in the Sylvan Haven, contains a powerful magical artifact known as the "Shard of Dissolution." This mysterious and dangerous item is a crystalline shard that emanates a faint, ominous glow.

The Obscurans intended to use the Shard of Dissolution to disrupt the harmony of Arventia, causing chaos and erasing the technological and magical advancements that the Arcknights have worked so hard to maintain. The box was meant to transport and conceal the dangerous artifact as it made its way into the hands of those willing to enact the Obscurans' dark plan.


## Session 2

Party made way to Lud Hearth and were given a quick history lesson about the Arcknights from the barkeep Tharivol. 

Party tried to go to the Feywild Bridge but before they could make it to the main part of the port they were told by an acolyte that all of the portals were busy. However, he informed them that all of the portals were taken but they did have a secret portal they could use in the alley way. 

Evaluna sent a bird to her fiancee Sven to retrieve her horse, Sven. While they were waiting for the horse, Evaluna and Ezekiel went to the market to find another horse or carriage and other items, leaving Sanid behind.

While Sanid was alone with the acolyte, the acolyte and his companions attacked him and stole his items and left him tied up in the alley.

Meanwhile, Ezekiel and Evaluna devised a plan to steal a horse from a local stand. Using his mage hand, Ezekiel untied 3 of the horses as a distraction. As everyone working the stand chased after the horses, he stole the horse that was left behind. The guards asked around but were unable to figure out who stole the horse. 

Ezekiel and Evaluna returned from the market to find the acolyte, who lied and said Sanid was looking for them in the market. However, Evaluna was able to see throug the lie. They left to wait for Sven to bring Sven. Tying up their horses, they went to confront the acolyte in the alley.

A battle commenced where Sanid was able to untie herself and they were able to kill the 3 people who attacked them. After searching their bodies, they burned them in the alleyway. However, guards came by and took them to the castle. At the castle, Lirael Nightbloom asked Evaluna to go hide away because he felt bad times were coming. He was able to convince Evaluna to go away with her companions. They decided to set sail East towards Aurora's Heart. 

They spent the night in the castle. The next day they went to the Lud Hearth and received their deciphered message, which read:

ONE PIECE HAS BEEN COLLECTED. WE WILL RESTORE ORDER

They spent the rest of the evening preparing. That night, they set sail on The Leviathans Embrace led by Captain Selene Stormrider. They became members of the crew and contributed to many of the ships needs. They also become proficient fisherman. 

While on the ship, they were attacked by beasts that came from the Feywild through a rift. The ship was boarded by Merfolk and Plesiosaurus. The party was able to defeat all of the enemies on the ship. The rest of their trip was smooth sailing as they are close to arriving at Aurora's Hearth.
