## Session 1

In the mystical city of Eldertop, our unlikely heroes converged at the Sylvan Haven, a bustling tavern where secrets whisper in every corner. Evaluna, the enigmatic Elf Druid, excused herself for an urgent talk with her father, Lirael Nightbloom, the Guardian of Eldertop.

Meanwhile, Ezekiel Hershberger, a warlock bound by eldritch pacts, and Sanid, the formidable half-orc fighter with a mysterious past, sought employment from Thalindra Leafwhisper. The quest was unveiledâ€”a precious artifact, the Shard of Dissolution, stolen from the Verdant Archive.

Cloaked figures spoke of an ambush, but skepticism lingered in the air. Ezekiel shadowed the hooded figures, discovering a clandestine meeting back at the Sylvan Haven where Sanid, ever vigilant, was approached by a persuasive stranger named Seraphina.

A deal was struck. Distraction ensued, chaos erupted, and the Shard changed hands under the veil of turmoil. Our heroes pursued Seraphina into the night, only to be ambushed outside the city gates by a horde of goblins and vengeful cloaked figures.

In a symphony of blades, spells, and cunning tactics, our party fought valiantly. Bodies fell, mysteries deepened, and as Seraphina vanished into the shadows of the woods, a mysterious encrypted message was uncovered.

As dawn broke, our heroes, battered but victorious, regrouped at the Sylvan Haven. In the morning light, they reunited with Evaluna, only to receive an enigmatic message beckoning them to the Lud Hearth. The stage is set, the plot thickens, and Eldertop holds its secrets close as our adventurers embark on a journey woven with intrigue and danger.

## Serphina and the Box

Seraphina stole the Box from the cloaked figures - the Box contains the [Shard of Dissolution](https://github.com/mspencedm/Arventia/blob/main/Items/ShardOfDissolution.md). 

The ornate box, discovered by Seraphina in the Sylvan Haven, contains a powerful magical artifact known as the "Shard of Dissolution." This mysterious and dangerous item is a crystalline shard that emanates a faint, ominous glow.

The Obscurans intended to use the Shard of Dissolution to disrupt the harmony of Arventia, causing chaos and erasing the technological and magical advancements that the Arcknights have worked so hard to maintain. The box was meant to transport and conceal the dangerous artifact as it made its way into the hands of those willing to enact the Obscurans' dark plan.
