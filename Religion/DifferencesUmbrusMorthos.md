In the cosmic pantheon of Arventia, Umbrus and Morthos stand as contrasting embodiments of shadows, each bearing distinct influences upon the realms they touch. Umbrus, The Shadowed Patron, is a mysterious force that navigates the ethereal realms with an air of enigmatic wisdom. On the other hand, Morthos, The Umbral Despot, emerges as a malevolent entity, a darker counterpart whose essence is steeped in malefic intent.

## Umbrus
Umbrus is a deity shrouded in cosmic mysteries, his shadows fostering an exploration of concealed truths and the unknown. The followers of Umbrus, known as Shroudseekers, are drawn to the alluring whispers of hidden knowledge and the esoteric nature of the shadows. Umbrus' philosophy, while veiled, is not inherently malevolent but rather encourages seekers to delve into the profundities of existence.

## Morthos
In stark contrast, Morthos, The Umbral Despot, stands as a malevolent force fueled by a sadistic pleasure derived from the despair of others. The followers of Morthos, adherents known for their ruthlessness, are tasked with sowing discord and embracing the unbridled force of darkness. Morthos' philosophy is marked by dominance, shadow, and the pursuit of power at any cost, fostering a doctrine that thrives on the suffering of others.

## Why Morthos is More Malevolent
The distinction lies in the fundamental nature of their influence. Umbrus, while mysterious and often associated with the unknown, does not inherently seek harm. His followers, the Shroudseekers, pursue knowledge and enlightenment within the shadows. On the contrary, Morthos revels in the malevolence of shadows, encouraging his adherents to spread despair, seek dominance without restraint, and embrace a sadistic pleasure in the suffering of others.

While Umbrus' shadows may conceal truths and mysteries, Morthos' shadows serve as a tool for subjugation, discord, and unrelenting darkness. Morthos' malefic intent makes him more overtly evil, as his philosophy actively seeks to undermine the cosmic balance and spread suffering across the realms. In the cosmic dance of light and shadow, Umbrus and Morthos represent the duality of shadows, one embracing the unknown, and the other exploiting it for malevolent ends.
