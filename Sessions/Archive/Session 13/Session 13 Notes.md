## General


Let's do this thing!!!

Players return to Aurora's Heart and want a job

They did just get drunk at the bar The Silver Moon - the bar in the Order of Lunar Ascendancy. They learn about this thing called the Veil which is this underground network of trade within Arventia. 

They met Maelis the mapmaker who kind of predicted their future? I'm sure we will be seeing more of her and definitely hearing more from her - provided sending stone. 

Also vision of CloudCutter flying through the skies with Icarus alongside him - Icarus has wings
