## Summary

Transition away from Christmas schedule and bam we are back to the plot


## Prison

Oh look the gang is back in Prison in Barovia because they burned down Death House


They still need to kidnap the daughter - Mira Bronzehammer 


## Dragon's Deal to get out of Prison

The players can make a final petition to get out of prison. If they do they are released! I'm going to just let them plead their case. 



## Deal to Get Out of Prison

Pay 1000 gold pieces each - I mean death house was expensive. He will negotiate to as low as 500 gp each. Or he will do a deal (listed below)

Bromir Bronzehammer has a secret - a son he had when he was 20 years old with his wife - it was right when he took the throne so they were afraid they were not going to be able to raise the child. They gave him up so that they could focus on learning how to rule without having to raise a child but now regrets never knowing him. He has heard rumblings that someone with the name he has given his son is in Waterdeep as they have been asking around. They want to reconnect with him since he is the rightful heir and it would be the least disruptive to raise him when their other son, Darin, does not yet know. 


Information:

- Bromir Bronzehammer has a secret son named **Kael Sunderblade**, given up at birth because Bromir was becoming king.  
- Kael was entrusted to **Thalindra Ironfaith**, a 27-year-old priestess of Haela Brightaxe, and raised in the Temple of Haela in Waterdeep.  
- At the age of 10, Kael ran away from the temple.  
- Recently, Bromir has heard rumors of Kaelâ€™s name resurfacing in Waterdeep and tasks the players with finding him.  
- Bromir provides a note containing a seal, a baby picture of Kael, and a bronze necklace holding the top part of an axe blade. The necklace pairs perfectly with another piece Bromir kept, which holds the axe handle.


They have to sign a scroll of binding accord to agree to find his son.




## Return to Eldertop

The dragon is letting you go on a 2 week break (ya know after the Christmas special) and as a Christmas gift will drop you (within reasonable limitation) to a destination of your choosing - this will be the improvised D&D session but we will try to incorporate some plot with dragons and some enemies of the dragon nature - if they choose Arventia then there will definitely be talk of dragons and portals.


Kind of a random free for all session so I'll have to take lots of good notes etc.
