# Session 4

## Player Characters

## NPCs

## Plot Points


### Cutbacks

The city will announce that they will be paying half their usual price for items looted in the forst - much harder if not near impossible to make a good living on that. 

Repurcussions I'm sure will occur


### The Rumor

Rumors about stuff getting stolen continue.

As far as werewolves, no one knows anything about them. At all. Completely stumped.

### The Arcane Academy's Secret

The Arcane Academy is secretly researching the cure to werewolf bites and stopping people from turning into werewolves. Tests so far have been unsuccessful but it's hard to figure out since they all become werewolves.
