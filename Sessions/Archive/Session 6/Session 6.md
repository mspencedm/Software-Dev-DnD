## Summary



## Prison Escape

Start the session reminding players that they are in prison - make them remove all items except magic keepers can keep their spellcasting item and they can have clothes.

"These are chaotic times" and "we don't know who to beleive" 

Players will notice overnight that there is a full moon. Winny will turn into a werewolf. This will be a contributing decision to why the players are being sent to death row. Because of Aurora Dawnswell's generous heart, she has decided that she will take the child to the Temple of Amoria since he is only a child and hasn't done anything wrong. But they will have to figure something out. 

The Temple of Amoria will be warned about his condition and will, in turn, talk to the Arcane Academy, who will take the child in, but Sil has a lot of intentions with the child as he wants to study him, not to find a cure, but to perfect his serum. 


### Welcome to Death Row

The players find themselves on deathrow. They have about 5 hours to put together an escape plan. Be generous and let the players escape on their own - they will have nothing. Players fail to escape - they will be put to death next to other rebel scum. 


### Split Ways - Players Successfully Escape

The players succesfully escape from deathrow but are left with nothing. If they try to retrieve their stuff, they will notice it is all being stored in the barracks surrounded by guards. 

Full moon during the middle of the night - Winny will transform into a werewolf. Players may try to find him but will not be able to. If they ask Amoria will generously inform them of her decision to give Winny to the temple. 

Players escape with nothing but hte clothes on their back. No money. No nothing. They are going to need to find out what would be best to do next.

Sven will be back in town. Sven may be their saving grace. He will return with news that Eldertop is basically destroyed. The biggest news - it is now being ruled by a dragon - red fire dragon has scorched the city. He has not heard back anything about Lirael, Evaluna's dad, it seems as if he has fallen off the face of the planet - no one knows where he is. Sven barely made it out alive as Eldertop begins to crumble.

This news is slowly making its way to Aurora's Heart.

Sven will have just enough money to buy them some very basic weapons but not much else. Players are going to need to figure out a way to make more money.

Make up on the spot: guilds or jobs that the different temples want done that they will pay for completing. Wanted boards on taverns etc. things of that nature. Alternatively they could also do normal jobs of course. 


### Split Ways - Players Do Not Succesfully Escape

Players are lined up on death row besides 3 other figures. The 3 figures beside you - they are all wearing masks

Varis "Roar" King - 28 year old man wearing a lion mask

Garrick "X" Horn - 58 year old man wearing an ox mask

Zara "Chain" Queen - 26 year old female wearing a lion mask


As you are standing chained in the middle of the city on death row, the 3 people next to you will unchain themselves by breaking the chain as they all transform into these werebeasts, their masks ripping apart. They will begin to attack the guards but will be focused on running away.


If you follow you can join their Group - the Order of Lunary Ascendancy.
