## Summary

Players have escaped prison and now are kind of scattered without purpose and no money - barely weapons. Let's give them some purpose.


## Eldertop

Eldertop is now ruled by a dragon - Sven will come back and report that information. He has not heard back anything about Lirael, Evaluna's dad, it seems as if he has fallen off the face of the planet - no one knows where he is. Sven barely made it out alive as Eldertop begins to crumble

Sven will just have enough money to buy them some very basic weaposns?

Players need to make money
