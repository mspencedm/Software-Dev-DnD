## Summary

I believe the goal from here on out is going to be to make it easier for me to DM possibly especially if I can make sure I kind of maintain a story in Arventia that is broad so I can keep my story but for some leveling and fun I can get them into the forgotten realms.


### Dreams

Everyone has a dream that is somehow going to be linked to this dragon. Essentially the dragon wants everyone to agree to work for him and become "Planar Wings" - servants for him - followers. He will be able to restore all their hopes and dreams as long as they follow his commands. 

His goal is to save Arventia from the gods and other planes and only he and his fellow dragons are powerful enough to do so. Dragon is willing to give anything basically to have them as servants - money - fame - restore anything etc. 

Will give a demonstration of his power if needed.




### Consider the Deal

I'm sure the players will have lots of questions etc. about this deal and probably won't believe it but we will see if they take it. If so, the players are going to be taken to the Forgotten Realms - Waterdeep! 

Should be easier to plan adventures in Waterdeep and the Forgotten Realms beecause I won't have to plan anything.



### Players Refuse the Deal

If players refuse the deal then I will try and push them more into the guild route and they will probably spend tiem traveling etc. will probably need a random encounter or something along those lines.

I actually have a fair amount of plot strings so also players could consider the deal later and want ot wrap up some plot things here - this is regarding things like the guilds and werewolves.

Maybe have the players travel to the next nearby town - Greenhearth

Greenhearth will have its Harvest Festival week occurring to give players a bigger reason to stay. This is a quiet, quaint forest town. It relies heavily on Aurora's Heart and is almost essentially a small town sector of the city. It greatly respects Queen Aurora and is essentially just another part of this larger city. Arventia doesn't have established regions yet but if it did this would definitely be a connected region.


Concern - there seems to be a disruption in Mother Nature and Greenhearth can feel a disturbance.


### Mother Nature Attacks

In Greenhearth during the Harvest Festival mother nature attacks! Is Verdis upset? No one knows what's happening but it looks like nature, who they respect and worship so much, is fighting against them.

Probably try to tie the fight into the will-o-wisps and have it be at night?

Encounter - Greenhearth Havest Festival
