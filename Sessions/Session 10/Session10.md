## Summary

Welcome to the Red Dragon Games (RDG)


## Rules of the Game

I'm going to slowly teach the players earlier that this "game" isn't really that much of a game at all - and the rules change and its unfair - but so is life



## Off on Our First Adventure

Players set off on their first adventure - probably in the Forgotten Realms - this is when players will slowly have to learn that each DM can kind of just change the rules and my version of the forgotten realms will be different. But not today - today we will be making a spin-off of castle Ravenloft and Barovia and also just have it linked to the Forgotten Realms by the Ethereal Plane - less relevant as we are now Plane Travelers.


## Dragon's Mark

You get a mark by the Red Dragon that will give you the ability to communicate all the time with other party members. Only one person can communicate through this channel at one time (similar to a radio) but its a 1:1 connection. The captain chosen can always override the current communication but other people if the line is busy their message won't go through. It's easy for party members to use they just have to check to see if the line is open (will hear rushing wind sound) and send a message - if they try to connect and there is no rushing wind sound the line is currently closed or in use. Captain can always override but the other message being transmitted will immediately drop. Hvae players come up with hand signal system.


## An Invitation

Red dragon provides an invitation to an exclusive party at Ravenloft. They are guests.


## The Party

The party will be in charge of protecting the family of the Bronzehammers. This will be the freedom ceremony anniversary for the 50th year free from Strahd.

During this party they are going to be attacked by a lot of different things but they are also going to be able to interact and meet some cool people - this will be a good way for them to learn about Waterdeep and start really getting connected.


## Dinner

Dinner will begin in the grand hall and then the table will disappear and the party will start with music - the kids will be there for dinner but will depart. The party will need to split and decide where they are going.
