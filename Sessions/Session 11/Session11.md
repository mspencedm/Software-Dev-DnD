## Summary

Players have to kidnap the kid


## Breakfast

Breakfast and players learn there's an exciting event occurring, along with the party last night to celebrate Barovia's Freedom there is a new celebration that Bromir Bronzehammer is surprising the kingdom with since its the 50th anniversary and all.

In the back of Barovia he has created a replica of The Death House (Castle Bronzehammer) - where Strahd used to live - and filled it with a variety of things.

He is basically doing a haunted house that ends in the main room with a re-enactment of Bronzehammer killing Strahd


Bromir will open the new Death House last day of Leaffall - grand opening  with re-enactment - going to be the start of an amusement park attraction to try to gain crowds and honor the past.


He wants you to go through and explore death house  a leave a review


He will pay you well for your trouble - 240gp (each) 

Strahd will be unable to accompany you as he has guests in the castle from Waterdeep as he is beginning his treaty negotiations with the country Amn with the hope of being more connected to Faerun and to kind of join more into that world and the Sword Coast. 


## Exploring Death House

Players may try to convince the daughter to go - see how that works. 


The rest of the module should take place in Death House which will be the Halloween event - some of it will be derived from Strahd Death House

Looks like this won't work so we may do malfunctioned evil Death House in a different session
