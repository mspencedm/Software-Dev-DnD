### **Blackmail Letter to Nyssa Veymar**

*Sealed with The Gilded Guard's Mark*  
*(A gold crescent moon encircling a stylized, interlocking trade ring, symbolizing the security and control over the flow of goods and secrets in Aurora's Heart)*

**Nyssa Veymar,**

The *Moonshadow Hourglass* is gone, but don’t fool yourself—your Order has no idea who took it, or where it’s heading. If you think you can stop what’s coming, you’re mistaken. The trade of secrets in Aurora's Heart is not unlike the trade of goods, Nyssa, and it’s only a matter of time before the right *offer* is made.

You have a choice, and your next step will determine everything. Do as I ask, and I’ll ensure your place within the Order remains secure. Fail, and I’ll ensure the truth of what you’ve been *guarding*—and what you’ve *been hiding*—is exposed across the trade routes. The Gilded Guard has eyes everywhere, and you won’t be able to hide from the whispers.

Meet me at **midnight** in **The Silver Hollow** by the old docks. Bring the item I seek. Do not waste time.

I have no interest in your Order’s rituals or their outdated ideals. My loyalty lies with the *right price*.

- **A Benefactor in the Shadows**
