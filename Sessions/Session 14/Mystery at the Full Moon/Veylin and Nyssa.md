# Veylin and Nessa

### **The Lunar Shackle: The Forbidden Experiment of Veylin & Nyssa**  

Veylin Renshaw and Nyssa Veymar were once **inseparable**, two rising stars in the **Order of Lunar Ascendancy** who dreamed of **breaking the moon’s hold** over lycanthropes. Together, they devised the **Lunar Shackle**, a ritual meant to **grant full control over transformation**, allowing lycans to shift at will—free from celestial influence.  

#### **The Experiment & Nyssa’s Last-Minute Betrayal**  
On the **Night of the Veiled Moon**, the two gathered a handful of **willing participants** and conducted the ritual in secrecy.  

The ritual required:  
- **Sigils of silver and wolfsbane**, arranged in an eclipsed moon formation.  
- **Blood willingly given**, symbolizing the severance of lunar ties.  
- A **moonstone focus**, meant to store and redistribute lycanthropic essence.  

To gather these rare materials, **Veylin arranged secret dealings with smugglers in the Crossroads**—the Veil Consortium provided **rare moonstones** and alchemical components, no questions asked, in exchange for a **favor yet to be named**.  

As the ritual neared completion, the magic **began to take hold**—their control over their transformations wavered, their connection to the moon **faltering**. But as power surged through the moonstone, Nyssa suddenly **hesitated**.  

She felt something **wrong**, something unnatural in the weave of magic they had tapped into. The moment she realized it **couldn’t be undone**, she **panicked** and **broke the sigil** on her side of the ritual.  

**Disaster followed.**  

- The unstable magic **lashed out**, sending a shockwave through the chamber.  
- Some participants **lost control of their shifting**, becoming stuck between wolf and human.  
- Others felt the moon’s pull **vanish entirely**, unable to shift at all.  
- Veylin, caught in the backlash, **saw something in the moonstone—another moon, unseen in the sky.**  

Terrified of what they had done, **Nyssa fled to the elders and confessed everything.**  

#### **The Aftermath: Veylin’s Exile**  
- **Veylin took the full blame.** The elders branded the ritual as **forbidden magic** and declared her **a heretic**. She was **exiled** from the Order, her name stricken from their records.  
- **Nyssa was spared.** Though she had been involved, her last-minute betrayal was seen as **a sign of repentance**, and her testimony against Veylin **saved her from exile**.  
- The other participants were treated for the effects of the failed ritual, though **some never regained full control over their transformations.**  

**The Veil Consortium never forgot Veylin’s debt.** Since then, she has **maintained connections** with smugglers and information brokers, always searching for a way to **finish what she started**—but she now knows she **wasn’t the only one funding the experiment.** Someone **else** had an interest in the ritual’s success.  

#### **Lingering Effects**  
- **Veylin:** Her shifting is **unstable**, and she has **visions of an unseen moon**. She believes the Order is **hiding a greater truth** and will **do anything** to finish what she started.  
- **Nyssa:** Though she remains in the Order, she carries the **guilt of her betrayal**. Now, with the **blackmail letter** in her possession, she fears that **someone knows what she did.**  

Would you like the **moonstone focus** to still exist, potentially in the hands of the Veil Consortium?
