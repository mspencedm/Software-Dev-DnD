## Summary

They are back in Arventia


The plot will need to continue in Arventia without them - I'm going to make this another full moon so the Order of Lunar Ascendancy is going to have their Full Moon Festival. Each full moon festival should be slightly different themed after the diety the month is named after? 



### Tragedy Before Festival of Timewatch

Guild leader remembers that the part asks for work.

The Moonshadow Hourglass sacred artifact for the ceremony has been stolen. They currently have 3 suspects.

They believe they are trying to sell the hourglass at The Crossroads, which is ran by the Veil Consortium, the secret underground trade network (whcih has slowly turned even more into a black market as the portal trade has come to an end with the shattering of the portals - used to just be to try to avoid tariffs but has gotten worse).


Find the hourglass before the festival tonight or if not tonight eventually as they would like it back but more they want to show that no one can cheat the Order without having to pay for it. 


See Mystery at the Full Moon Festival for the rest of the information.

If they find this hourglass, for the remainder of their first year as part of the Order of Lunar Ascendancy they will get 1/2 off food and drinks throughout all of Aurora's Heart. They will also be given more vials of lyncanthropy potion.
