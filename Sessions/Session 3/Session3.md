## Summary

Players Arrive in Aurora's Heart



## Backstory Link

I'm going to need to create dreams related to everyone's backstory so we can start having some motivation and skin in the game.

This is going to be right at the beginning as I'm going to make it dark and encourage everyone to go to the tavern and sleep.


## Introduce New Characters

Introduce new characters at the bar - I think I'm going to just have them be sitting there.


## Plot Hooks

### Ezekiel's Book

When he awakens from his dream, Ezekiel's Tome is going to start shaking and vibrating. When he opens it, the 3rd page is going to have new writing, the words on the page cursive and flowy as if written by the shadows itself. 

It reads:

"I have a task for you, my servant. Venture into the Cliffwood Bluffs. There's a group of people who reside in caves along the cliffs. They do not submit to my bidding. I need you to destroy them. Every one. Leave not one soul alive. As a reward, any loot or reward they have is yours. Do my bidding." 

Cult is along the North Cliffs.

### Rumors

Rumor going around the town about a group of outcasts and ravagers and terrible people living in the cliffs and woods. Wish they would go away. They bring harm to the community and are outsiders - occassionally they come into town but we want nothing to do with them. Crazy lunatics who believe the Arcknights don't exist. 


Additionally, another rumor is whispers about the bandits who reside in the caves and keep stealing from the community. Kids keep sneaking off and are missing dinner etc.


Bandits are inside the South Cliffs.


### Lost Dog

On the outskirts of town one of the nearby farmers lost their guard dog in the woods - important to get him back because there's a lot of wolves out there and they need a way to protect their sheep.

German Shephard named Bruiser



## Cliffwood Bluffs

Players enter woods. I'm thinking of having multiple plot hooks in these woods so make it pretty foresty. Have a lot of diffrent things for the players to accomplish.


### Encounter 1

This encounter is going to be small and easy but its really just to scare the players and make them remember that the woods are dangerous. Also leaves good reason for why everyone else is a bit scared of the woods. I'm thinking wolves here. 

Wolf Encounter 1 on DND Beyond - has 2 regular wolves and 2 dire wolves


If players are wandering around the woods too long looking for Bruiser or they really seem to be getting distracted and not really looking for the cliffs etc. keep sending wolves after them


### Tracking

#### Right Side (south side)

Bandits are on this side, so players are going to see footprints, not hidden well. Amatuar thieves.

After some wandering, players will be able to find the cave that leads to the bandits hideout.

#### Left Side (north side)

The Apostates from the Cult of Obscurans are going to be residing here. This is going to be a lot mroe footprints and they will be easy to see since they aren't trying to hide. Additionally, some footprints will be children's. 

Outside of this cave there is going to be food planted and animals hanging as food storage etc. Clearly going to look like a community has been developing here, but a hidden one. 

After some wandering, players will be able to find the cave that leads to The Apostates from the Cult of Obscurans. 


##### Note

The rest of the session should take place at the Cliffwood Bluffs where the rest of the notes of how things go in this area play out. Outside of this area, session notes remain here.
