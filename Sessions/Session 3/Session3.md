## Summary

Players Arrive in Aurora's Heart



## Backstory Link

I'm going to need to create dreams related to everyone's backstory so we can start having some motivation and skin in the game.

This is going to be right at the beginning as I'm going to make it dark and encourage everyone to go to the tavern and sleep.


## Introduce New Characters

Introduce new characters at the bar - I think I'm going to just have them be sitting there.
