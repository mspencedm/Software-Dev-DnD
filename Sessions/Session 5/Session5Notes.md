## Player Characters

### Sanid's Dream

You are isolated and alone in the woods. You hear the crying of a child. You start running, racing towards the crying. You beat back the leaves of the trees as the foliage becomes thicker and thicker. It is as if the trees are enclosing on you. You break through some thick part of the forest and come to a clearing, a beam of light shining down onto this spot. You come to a sudden stop as your heart skips a beat and your breath catches.

There, standing in the clearing, holding a baby boy is your wife...She turns towards you and smiles. 

Before you can react, the sun around you melts as the moon sets into the sky. The child stops wailing, but to your horror, it begins to transform, as hair begins to grow. The child cries in pain as it becomes a beast, a monster your oh so familiar with, the familiar recognition of a werewolf. Your wife doesn't seem appalled, in fact, she begins to laugh, then chuckle, before she cries out "Yes it worked!!! I have created a monster." She then looks towards you as her features melt away as she transforms into a blue dragonborn. You try to move and get closer to them but the trees start to cave in on you as they are walking away and you are bolted awake. 

(If Winny is nearby)
When you awake you hear Winny crying

## Plot Points

### Cries in the Night

Each night if Winny is dramatically crying and feels a strong state of emotion he will lose control and turn into a werewolf.

If it is a full moon Winny will turn into a werewolf that night.

If Winny bites anyone they will have to make a constitution saving throw. DC 5


### Mark of Morthos

The children who are all marked by Morthos are complaining about seeing apparations. They are brought to the Arcane Academy for a cure to be found.

Legend says there is a special stone of purification and healing that can be found in an underwater cave. No one goes because there is a beast living out of hte cave that is bringing down ships plus it's probably a myth anyway. Take the chance?


### Reward for Service

Trade has become hard in Aurora's Heart with the loss of Eldertop. Of course, there are other coastal cities, but everyone is being extra diligent. 

Unfortuantely for the city, trade has also been slow because there has been a beast bringing down ships in the depths of the waters near the dock so ships have been having to go around, which takes more time and is hard to track. 

This is now becoming known as The Tempest's Maw. If someone ventures out to the section of water and can investigate what is happening, then they will gain a big reward (500GP) if they can prove they put an end to the nonsense.

### The Tempest's Maw

Somehow players will need to figure out that this is a dungeon completely underwater that they are going to have to swim down to go to. 

If player's ask around they will find out that some people have traveled into the Tempest's Maw for the reward as well and found a lot of items underneath the water. There is something down there.

See the Tempest's Maw for all the information.




### Child of Amoria

If they are walking around town the party will see a group of orphans running around outside the Temple of Amoria. The temple takes in orphans as they love and care on the loss. 

They will offer to watch Winny. 

Additionally, the Temple of Amoria will be a good place to learn more about the stone of purification. Some call it the Stone of Central Essence (if someone has a history with Amoria or rolls high on religion they may gather that this is a shard name).
