## Player Characters

### Sanid's Dream

You are isolated and alone in the woods. You hear the crying of a child. You start running, racing towards the crying. You beat back the leaves of the trees as the foliage becomes thicker and thicker. It is as if the trees are enclosing on you. You break through some thick part of the forest and come to a clearing, a beam of light shining down onto this spot. You come to a sudden stop as your heart skips a beat and your breath catches.

There, standing in the clearing, holding a baby boy is your wife...She turns towards you and smiles. 

Before you can react, the sun around you melts as the moon sets into the sky. The child stops wailing, but to your horror, it begins to transform, as hair begins to grow. The child cries in pain as it becomes a beast, a monster your oh so familiar with, the familiar recognition of a werewolf. Your wife doesn't seem appalled, in fact, she begins to laugh, then chuckle, before she cries out "Yes it worked!!! I have created a monster." She then looks towards you as her features melt away as she transforms into a blue dragonborn. You try to move and get closer to them but the trees start to cave in on you as they are walking away and you are bolted awake. 

(If Winny is nearby)
When you awake you hear Winny crying

## Plot Points

### Cries in the Night

Each night if Winny is dramatically crying and feels a strong state of emotion he will lose control and turn into a werewolf.

If it is a full moon Winny will turn into a werewolf that night.

If Winny bites anyone they will have to make a constitution saving throw.


### Mark of Morthos

The children who are all marked by Morthos are complaining about seeing apparations. They are brought to the Arcane Academy for a cure to be found.

Legend says there is a special stone of purification and healing that can be found in an underwater cave. No one goes because there is a beast living out of hte cave that is bringing down ships plus it's probably a myth anyway. Take the chance?


### Child of Amoria

If they are walking around town the party will see a group of orphans running around outside the Temple of Amoria. The temple takes in orphans as they love and care on the loss. 

They will offer to watch Winny.
