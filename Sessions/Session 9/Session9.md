## Summary

Deliver the REd Dragon this whole competition like he's hosting a TV show.



## Deal with the Dragon

Players are going to make their deal with the dragon. Based on the deal I need to figure out how to interpret it in a different manner to screw the players hehehhe because of course that's what you do


## Red Dragon's Challenge

The Red Dragon is going to challenge the players and make sure they are qualified for the position


### Dust & Devil's One Shot

Modify the starting in jail part to the fact its the Red Dragon's challenge and then most likely can just follow the one-shot


#### Running Commentary

As the players reach certain part we can have the dragon running it almost like a TV show where he is watching and observing and interacting and maybe even narrating? 


### Accepted

Players are accepted by the Red Dragon. They will get one last day in Arventia and then they are bound.



## We're Not in Arventia Anymore

The players pass their initiation and the real adventure begins. They are now hired by the red dragon to go across to the different portals in exchange for their wishes. They are essentially leaving Arventia behind - the other events from Arventia will happen and occur as expected without them. It will be strange when they come back - we will see if they have ways to get news. 

It will be interesting to see if the players remember Arventia but they will have to learn new systems etc. everywhere they go.

Waterdeep - maybe do an adventure at that point? Gotta conform to the level
