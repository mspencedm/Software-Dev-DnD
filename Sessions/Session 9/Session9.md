## Summary




## Deal with the Dragon

Players are going to make their deal with the dragon. Based on the deal I need to figure out how to interpret it in a different manner t oscrew the players hehehhe because of course that's what you do


## Portal to Waterdeep

As promised, the players are going to go to Waterdeep. This will transition my D&D Campaign and really open it up to a lot of different places which will be a pretty cool thing to be able to do.


## Red Dragon's Challenge

The Red Dragon is going to challenge the players and make sure they are qualified for the position


### Dust & Devil's One Shot

Modify the starting in jail part to the fact its the Red Dragon's challenge and then most likely can just follow the one-shot


#### Running Commentary

As the players reach certain part we can have the dragon running it almost like a TV show where he is watching and observing and interacting and maybe even narrating?
