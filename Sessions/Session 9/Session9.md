## Summary




## Deal with the Dragon

Players are going to make their deal with the dragon. Based on the deal I need to figure out how to interpret it in a different manner t oscrew the players hehehhe because of course that's what you do


## Portal to Waterdeep

As promised, the players are going to go to Waterdeep. This will transition my D&D Campaign and really open it up to a lot of different places which will be a pretty cool thing to be able to do.
