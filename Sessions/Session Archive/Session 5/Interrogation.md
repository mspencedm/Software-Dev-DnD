The Child - Winny

Joined recently - this is where I am meant to be

Child came from a lady named Seraphina - she had found the child somewhere and then gave us the child

First day meeting Seraphina - met at the village in the forest - no village in the forest anymore - Ezekiel assaulted a woman

Ezekiel has been impulsive - caused a lot of trouble in the village in the forest - what village - children that have markings on their face - outskirts of the village - may have been hired on as merceneries to kill villagers in the forest - Ezekiel hired children

Ezekiel and the farmland children killed the peopel in the village forest - after Ezekiel and the farmland children killed everyone - Seraphina the lady you met in the forest - decides to give you a child - she has no connection to the baby - don't know why Seraphina wasn't killed

Marketplace - exploring the rest of the town as a much needed break - gave companion Ezekiel some silver pieces for food and drink - he saw a line - chose to get in front of the line - angered the people in the line - first person in line was choked by Ezekiel




## Sable

Village in the forest - don't know much about it - we stumbled upon it - looking for the creatures to hunt - they were interesting people who lived there - don't know much about teh village - just stumbled upon it

The Child - Winny - Winny was with someone else and that someone didn't want Winny anymore - we didn't want to leave him defenseless - random person you don't know gave her a child (crazy lady) - don't remember the past couple of days because of alcohol - possibly at night? - met in the forest - traveling in the forest - nomadic - having the baby out of some circumstance - it wasn't her 

Forest village - no clue on the name - small village - like 50 or so - going as a group so was heading up the back - close to the rocks - don't like people were asked to leave - emphasized need for privacy

Ezekiel has been nothing but a nusance and a terror - does thing sthat are unpredictable and out of hand - hurt people - we keep him along because we have been trying ot help him - thinks he doesn't understand how to be normal - help him improve and become a better person

Ezekiel's Antics - assault - dislike to one of the farmers in the outskirts - kind of aggressive towards him - stole his bed - mentally unstable - Raj - that was him - all of us care about him - tried to find the dog - unfortuantely the dog passed away - mystery - met his end with one of hte creatures in the forest - found the body of the dog - Raj is having a hard time

Ezekiel at the market - everyone else was checking out the shops - didn't understand you couldn't go to the front of the line - got angry - started acting inappropriately 

Why are you traveling with these people - bumpy road - met them and was going to make money helping them wiht their ventures

Hiring for - showing them the surrounding area - hired like a guide - pick up some jobs in the forest 


I think that some of them are not so bad - the elf and the ogre are not too bad - they were the ones who tried to find the dog. I think Ezekiel needs to be trained up. 

Ezekiel doesn't understand the severity. Expressed some negative thoughts about wanting to hurt others - not sure if he has acted on them. 

He did talk about killing big groups of people - tried to organize something - there were some lawsuits



## Evaluna

Why are you here - one bad person - Ezekiel seems to get us in trouble a lot

Situation in our city - Ezekiel got upset because he wanted food and so he didn't understand the circumstance so he choked someone - other previus aggression - doesn't like poeple who look different than him - doesn't like anyone other than humans

Violent Acts by Ezekiel - Particularly aggressive to children - No problem with Winny - tried to use children to slaughter a village in the outskirts of the city - he did slaughter everyone in the village

Village in the outskirts of the city in the forest - don't remember where the children were from - village nearby - I've been trying to get rid of him

Think he deserves death - has taken many lives - especially kids. How were you involved in the middle of this slaughter - behind our backs went out of our way to hire children to slaughter children - happened to be in your group - couldn't stop the children and him from killing the villagers in the village - think so

Winny - got Winny from a lady named Seraphina - mysterious woman - met Seraphina in the forest - in the forest outskirts - when Ezekiel was murdering the village - Ezekiel wanted to murder the baby so we took the baby - Seraphina didn't want to give you the baby but you took it to keep it safe

That is everything.


## Sanid

What happened at the shops - Walk in all having a grand time - pretty peaceful (not usually peaceful - bickering with Sable) at shops aedmiring blacksmith's work - getting hungry - send Ezekiel to get food - turn around and see he is choking a woman out 

Where did you get Winny - found Winny through Seraphina

Seraphina - found her at the cave clutching the baby - which is how we met Winny

Ezekiel (wish we could get rid of him) - decides to put up a banner for all the people in the town - hires kids in the tavern - around 9 of them - paid them - wants to slaughter these innocenet people - up in the forest - forest village people that wanted to be left alone - Ezekiel wanted to slaughter them - we just wanted to protect the children - was going to pay the kids - didn't want to pay the kids - deciding to figure out a plan to knock out Ezekiel - Ezekiel and kids are all fighting - too late to do anything - trying to think of a plan to stop him and he rushes all in there - onslaught begins - we try to save the hired kids 

Met Seraphina way way back on another island - Eldertop - came from Eldertop - Seraphina summmoned you to go to Aurora's Heart from Eldertop. You followed her because she took a shard

Shard -Legend of the Shards. Found a shard - snatched from the cult people - valuable object Eldertop was bragging about - tried to steal it back - snath it back from the snatchers - the cult people - stole it for a second - got followed by the cult people - atacked by goblins - Seraphina dipped - then reached out to meet you here. Met to get the shard. Found Seraphina with the shard. 

Morthos. The god of shadows - Ezekiel's Arms is because of Morthos - shadow arms


Do whatever you want to him. 


## Ezekiel

Hail from Earth. Earth is a planet. Magic to be taken from Earth.

What happened at the market - the green one told me to go do that - she told you to choke someone - she wanted food and drinks - gave you money to choke someone for food and drinks

How did you meet - The green one me are knights - knights to protect a citizen from another land - Eldertop - Elf girl Evaluna - how has that been going so far? 

They all stabbed you in the eye - not sure - stabbed because they are evil

How did you meet Winny the baby - you know dogs - there was a village that we saved the city from - dog people - they were dogs and they ate dogs - dude ate the head off a dog - Raj's dog - dog person

Dog person - person who is also a dog

Big, stand up, covered in fur, look like a dog - village full of them - killed them all - village outside of the city in the forest -- small faction of peopole who lived here helped - compaions also killed dog people in the forest

Companions robbed you - each of them - stabbed in the eye and robbed.









## Ending

Morthos talked to Ezekiel and took his left arm. Ezekiel is given one last chance with Morthos. Shadow passed through their brains and erased their memories.
