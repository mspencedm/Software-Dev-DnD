## Summary

Seraphina has the Shard of Dissolution in the box and ran away. 

The players receive a message in the tavern from an anonymous person that tells them to meet at the Lud Hearth.


## The Ludon Hearth Revelation

As the party steps into The Lud Hearth, expecting to meet Seraphina, they are met with a surprising twist. Instead of the elusive figure, they are welcomed by a charming and eccentric priest of Ludon named Tharivol Quicksilver. With a twinkle in his eye, Tharivol invites them to witness Ludon's mysteries in the back of the tavern.

Entering a hidden alcove, the party discovers the Ludon altar. Tharivol, with a flourish of his hands, conjures illusions above the altarâ€”a captivating display that tells tales of Eldertop's history, Ludon's legendary pranks, and snippets of arcane knowledge. Intrigued, the party asks about Seraphina.

## The Enigma of Seraphina

Tharivol's expression shifts from playful to concerned as the party inquires about Seraphina. The illusionary images waver, revealing a shadowy figure resembling Seraphina. Tharivol explains that she's an acolyte who stole the Shard of Dissolution for the temple of Ludon but has not sent word back.

With a somber gaze, Tharivol uses his magical connection to seek Seraphina. A distant, ethereal echo is heard, suggesting she's on another plane, her presence flickering like a candle in the wind. Tharivol expresses worry, suspecting something might have gone awry.


## A Journey to the Docks

Tharivol implores the party for assistance, revealing that the Ludon temple hasn't heard from Seraphina since she undertook the task. He requests the party to visit the docks, where rumors suggest she might have been seen last.

As the party heads to the docks, they find the atmosphere tense. A group of unruly figures, aligned with a rival temple, confronts them, demanding answers. A combat encounter ensues as the party defends themselves, and the foes reveal knowledge of Seraphina's activities.

## Encounter - Rival Temples Clash

Adversaries: Members of a rival temple dedicated to the god of night, Umbrus deity.

Setting: The docks at dusk, with crates and barrels providing cover.

Objectives: Defend against the attackers and gather information about Seraphina's recent whereabouts.

Twist: The rival temple members have their own reasons for seeking Seraphina, and their deity's motivations might clash with Ludon's.


## Revelations and Shadows

After the skirmish, the party interrogates the defeated temple members, learning that Seraphina was last seen near an ancient portal on the outskirts of Eldertop. The portal is rumored to connect to a realm touched by trickster magic.

With newfound information, the party faces a choice: to delve into the mysteries beyond the portal and unravel the enigma of Seraphina or to return to the Ludon temple with the gathered information.
