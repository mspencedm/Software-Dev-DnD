# The Whispering Mermaid's Call

(Verse 1)

Come gather 'round, ye hearty souls,

To The Whispering Mermaid we'll go,

Where the waves they crash and the winds they blow,

And the sea sings tales of long ago.


(Chorus)

Hoist the sails and raise the mast,

For adventure awaits, both present and past,

In the heart of the tavern by the sea,

Where the drinks flow strong and the spirits are free.

(Verse 2)

From distant lands and stormy shores,

We've sailed the seas, we've fought the wars,

But in this tavern, we find our peace,

With friends and ale, our troubles cease.

(Chorus)

Hoist the sails and raise the mast,

For adventure awaits, both present and past,

In the heart of the tavern by the sea,

Where the drinks flow strong and the spirits are free.

(Bridge)

So raise a glass to the ocean's call,

To the sailors brave and the ships so tall,

For in The Whispering Mermaid's embrace,

We find our home, our resting place.

(Chorus)

Hoist the sails and raise the mast,

For adventure awaits, both present and past,

In the heart of the tavern by the sea,

Where the drinks flow strong and the spirits are free.

(Outro)

So come ye sailors, come ye all,

To The Whispering Mermaid's hallowed hall,

Where the tales are tall and the laughter's loud,

And the sea sings with a proud, strong crowd.
